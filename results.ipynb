    "\n",
    "To better identify which captions are truly funny, we designed a new *funny metric* that combines both the **proportion of votes** and the **popularity (number of votes)** of each caption.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Weighted funny and unfunny ratios\n",
    "\n",
    "We first compute the proportion of *funny* and *unfunny* votes relative to the total number of votes for each caption:\n",

    "\\text{unfunny\\_ratio} = \\frac{N_{\\text{unfunny}}}{N_{\\text{total}}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To give more importance to captions that received **more votes** (and are thus statistically more reliable), each ratio is weighted by the logarithm of the number of votes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{weighted\\_funny} = \\text{funny\\_ratio} \\times \\log(1 + N_{\\text{total}})\n",

    "\\text{weighted\\_unfunny} = \\text{unfunny\\_ratio} \\times \\log(1 + N_{\\text{total}})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The logarithmic weighting ensures that captions with many votes are emphasized, while preventing those with extremely high vote counts from dominating the score.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Standardization and combined score\n",
    "\n",
    "We then normalize both weighted ratios using **z-scores** to make them comparable across captions:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "z_{\\text{funny}} = \\frac{\\text{weighted\\_funny} - \\mu_{\\text{funny}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{funny}}}\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the two standardized scores are combined into a **single composite score**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{combined\\_score} = z_{\\text{funny}} - z_{\\text{unfunny}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A higher `combined_score` indicates captions that are **consistently rated funny** and **supported by a sufficient number of votes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Ranking\n",
    "\n",
    "All captions are then ranked according to this score:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{rank\\_funny} = \\text{rank}(-\\text{combined\\_score})\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Voting Distribution Curves:** Detect the “bored-rater effect” (scores declining as voters progress through captions).  \n",
    "- **Scatterplots / regplots:** Visual oddity (unusual objects, surreal images) vs. funniness scores.  \n",
    "- **Polarity / Subjectivity Histograms:** Comparing logical vs. emotional jokes.  \n",
    "- **Cultural Reference Heatmap:** Proper nouns (brands, celebrities, memes) frequency and funniness.  \n",
    "- **Side-by-Side Caption Examples:** One “timeless” vs. one “culture-specific” joke, annotated to show differences.  \n",
    "- **Spearmanr / Pearsonr:** Test correlation between rating order and score.  \n",
    "- **Histograms / PDF, CDF:** Distribution of culturally referential vs. non-referential captions.  \n",
    "- **Log / semilog plots:** Detect heavy-tailed patterns (a few jokes get very high scores).  \n",
    "- **Logistic regression:** Predict caption success from presence of cultural references.  \n",
    "- **Unsupervised clustering:** Group captions by bias-driven humor style.  \n",
    "- **Network graph:** Links between cultural references (brands / celebrities) and funniness.\n",
