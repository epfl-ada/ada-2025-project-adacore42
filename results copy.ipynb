    "### 1.2 Construction of a New Funny Metric\n",
    "\n",
    "To better identify which captions are truly funny, we designed a new *funny metric* that combines both the **proportion of votes** and the **popularity (number of votes)** of each caption.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Weighted funny and unfunny ratios\n",
    "\n",
    "We first compute the proportion of *funny* and *unfunny* votes relative to the total number of votes for each caption:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{funny\\_ratio} = \\frac{N_{\\text{funny}}}{N_{\\text{total}}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{unfunny\\_ratio} = \\frac{N_{\\text{unfunny}}}{N_{\\text{total}}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To give more importance to captions that received **more votes** (and are thus statistically more reliable), each ratio is weighted by the logarithm of the number of votes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{weighted\\_funny} = \\text{funny\\_ratio} \\times \\log(1 + N_{\\text{total}})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{weighted\\_unfunny} = \\text{unfunny\\_ratio} \\times \\log(1 + N_{\\text{total}})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The logarithmic weighting ensures that captions with many votes are emphasized, while preventing those with extremely high vote counts from dominating the score.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Standardization and combined score\n",
    "\n",
    "We then normalize both weighted ratios using **z-scores** to make them comparable across captions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "z_{\\text{funny}} = \\frac{\\text{weighted\\_funny} - \\mu_{\\text{funny}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{funny}}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "z_{\\text{unfunny}} = \\frac{\\text{weighted\\_unfunny} - \\mu_{\\text{unfunny}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{unfunny}}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the two standardized scores are combined into a **single composite score**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{combined\\_score} = z_{\\text{funny}} - z_{\\text{unfunny}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A higher `combined_score` indicates captions that are **consistently rated funny** and **supported by a sufficient number of votes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Ranking\n",
    "\n",
    "All captions are then ranked according to this score:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{rank\\_funny} = \\text{rank}(-\\text{combined\\_score})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The highest `combined_score` (most funny) receives rank 1.\n"

To fit with the previous format of dataC, reseting the index. We need to watch out, 540 exists in the new table. We need to remove it.\n",
    "2. Additionally, the date here is the day the finalist was announced, not the date the cartoon came out... something to keep in mind.\n",
    "3. Clean the format of the dates. Sometimes there is an \"estimated\" keyword, sometimes there is two dates, and sometimes, the year is missing. When there are two dates, I only keep the last date. When a year is missing from a date, look at the previous entry and take the year from there.\n",

    "5. The dates are prepared now and can be merged with our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Occupations dataset :\n",
    "\n",
    "To recognise occupations in the captions, a comprehensive list of all possible occupations must be constructed. The difficulty with this task is that official job titles that one may find online are too specific and do not correspond to occupations people tend to mention when speaking (or writing captions). Therefore, the constructed list of occupations has to contain both generic terms but also specific occupations. To do this, the following approach was taken:\n",
    "1. Five datasets of varying size and specificity were loaded. In total, these add up to around 33,000 occupations.\n",
    " - [**O*NET**](https://www.onetonline.org/find/all)  \n",
    " - [**ESCO (ESCO dataset v1.2.0)**](https://esco.ec.europa.eu/en/use-esco/download)   \n",
    " - [**Kaggle Job Description Dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ravindrasinghrana/job-description-dataset)  \n",
    " - [**US Labor Statistics (May 2024, all data)** ](https://www.bls.gov/oes/tables.htm)   \n",
    " - [**US Census Data (2018 Census Occupation Index)**](https://www.census.gov/topics/employment/industry-occupation/guidance/indexes.html)\n",
    "2. Each dataset is cleaned with the same function, included in the cell below. The steps taken for the cleaning are:\n",
    " - Make everything lowercase\n",
    " - split jobs at \"and\" in a way that \"sales and marketing manager\" becomes \"sales manager\" and \"marketing manager\".\n",
    " - split jobs of the form \"truck, ship, and boat driver\" becomes \"truck driver\", \"ship driver\" and \"boat driver\". \n",
    " - Other commmon cases such as this are also treated, see the function definition. There is still room for improvement in this aspect.\n",
    " - If there is a comma at the end, and it is followed by 2 or 1 words, remove the comma and the words.\n",
    " - Drop everything including \"in\" from the text\n",
    " - removing duplicates\n",
    "3. The list is enriched by adding a synonyms column which contains the occupation and its plural form. The idea was to enrich this list by using `spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')`. This however introduced synonyms that are not actual occupations \"valet <-> gentleman\". \n",
    "4. Around 1000 extra words are added \n",
    "5. The constructed list is saved as a `csv` file: `final_combined_occupations.csv`.\n",
