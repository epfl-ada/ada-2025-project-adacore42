# **Humor as a Mirror: Social Attitudes, Politics, and Biases in the The New Yorker Caption Contest**

## **Abstract**  
*A 150-word description of the project idea and goals. What’s the motivation behind your project? What story would you like to tell, and why?*

Humor is a universal yet complex form of expression. The more we think about it and the more complexes it becomes! An example of humor purposes could be in the way of dealing with more ‘serious’ matters [1] or easing social  tensions and establishing social bonds [2].

With this in mind, this project aim to investigate how jokes reflect societal traits and values. Our analysis will focus on three major themes: politics, gender, and taboos (or social biases). We will begin by examining what is generally perceived as “funny” and “unfunny,” and then explore how humor operates within each of these social domains. Finally, we will synthesize our findings to understand what humor reveals about the norms, power structures, and sensitivities of contemporary society.


## **Research Questions**  
The project is divided into **4 axes of research directions**:

### **1. Axis: Professions & Politics → Humor about Authority and Power: *"What are people laughing about?"***   
- “Which occupations appear most frequently, and how are they portrayed (ridiculed, admired)?” What stereotypes are recurrent (e.g., doctors are heroes, politicians are corrupt)?  
- Do captions reflect partisan leanings (Democrat vs. Republican) or mock political figures more broadly? Are the political jokes rated differently?

### **2. Axis: Humor in Time → Historical & Contextual Dimensions: *"When and why do jokes resonate?"*** 

*FILL*

### **3. Axis: Social Norms → Gender Roles & Taboos: *"What’s acceptable or not?"***  

*FILL*

### **4. Axis: Biases → Psychological and Cultural Mechanisms: *"Why do we find it funny?"***

## **Proposed Additional Datasets**  

*List the additional dataset(s) you want to use (if any), and some ideas on how you expect to get, manage, process, and enrich it/them. Show that you’ve read the docs and some examples, and that you have a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant. It is your responsibility to check that what you propose is feasible.*

1. **Five datasets are used to construct an exhaustive list of occupations**:  
   - [**O*NET**](https://www.onetonline.org/find/all)  
   - [**ESCO (ESCO dataset v1.2.0)**](https://esco.ec.europa.eu/en/use-esco/download)   
   - [**Kaggle Job Description Dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ravindrasinghrana/job-description-dataset)  
   - [**US Labor Statistics (May 2024, all data)** ](https://www.bls.gov/oes/tables.htm)   
   - : [**US Census Data (2018 Census Occupation Index)**](https://www.census.gov/topics/employment/industry-occupation/guidance/indexes.html)

   While these datasets contain their own methods of categorising jobs, the main concern for the project at this stage is **solely to construct a full list of occupations**, ranging from very specific titles to more general terms.  In total, these datasets add up to **~33,000 distinct occupations**, once the data is cleaned and treated. The list could be further enriched by including **synonyms and colloquial terms** for each job.

## **Methods**

### **Axis 1: Professions & Politics**  

The first step is to construct a **comprehensive, clean list of occupations**, which can be **specific** (e.g., *electromagnetic engineer*) or **general** (e.g., *physicist, nurse, doctor*). This has already been partially done by cleaning and merging the aforementioned occupation datasets.  

After this, the **jobs in each caption must be extracted and saved**, allowing us to:  
- Track the **count of occupations**  
- Analyze **where and when** they occur  
- Identify **co-occurring words** to label **recurrent stereotypes, ridicule, and mockery** of jobs  

A similar approach is taken for the **political research** of this axis:  
- Create a **list of political words**  
- Treat **ambiguous words** with care (e.g., *left* and *right* may or may not be political)  
- Once political words are located, analyse the **funniness score** of the caption  

**Visualisations produced by this axis include:**  
- **Bar charts** and **word clouds** for frequency of occupations  
- **Histograms** for frequency of professions over time  
- **Bar charts** for average funniness scores per category  
- Possibly **heatmaps** cross-tabulating professions and sentiments  

For the website presentation, it could be interesting to include **annotated cartoons** to display jobs being ridiculed.
