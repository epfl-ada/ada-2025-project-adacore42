Title : "Humor as a mirror : Social attitudes, politics, and biases in the The New Yorker Caption Contest"

Abstract: A 150 word description of the project idea and goals. What’s the motivation behind your project? What story would you like to tell, and why?

Humor is a universal yet complex form of expression. The more we think about it and the more complexes it beacomes !
An example of humor purposes could be in the way of dealing with more ‘serious’ matters [1] or easing social 
tensions and establishing social bonds [2].

With this in mind, this project aim to investigate how jokes reflect societal traits and values. 
Our analysis will focus on three major themes: politics, gender, and taboos (or social biases). 
We will begin by examining what is generally perceived as “funny” and “unfunny,” and then explore 
how humor operates within each of these social domains. Finally, we will synthesize our findings 
to understand what humor reveals about the norms, power structures, and sensitivities of contemporary society.
