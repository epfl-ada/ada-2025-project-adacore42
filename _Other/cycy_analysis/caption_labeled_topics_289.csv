Don’t feel too bad - I beat taxes too!,5
You should know never to ignore the pale horse.,62
"Oh, yes, Henry, that's a killer move.",8
"You can take my soul, but not before I take your queen.",6
Maybe you needed some skin in the game.,89
"Checkmate, skinny!  That means I get to live, I get the scythe, and I guess YOU are on your way to Mar-a-Lago!",30

You seem to have lost your killer instinct.,8
"Well, you can't cheat death, but it looks like you  can certainly beat it.",0
"I win again, but does every match have to be ""sudden death""?",20
I guess it's just not your day.  But the good news is I won.  So it's not mine either.,42
Sudden death?,20

Now I just have to worry about my taxes.,5
I hear you always do well in sudden death rounds.,20
Go ahead. It's your funeral.,53
I’d say you made a grave error there.,-1
Come closer so I can tell you what you've won.,1
"You did well with the plague, I’ll give you that, but you left your Queen wide open!",6

"I'm sorry, but your time is up.",18
You’re not the only one with a killer instinct!,8
Checkmate! And don't be a grim loser!,-1
Checkmate! I chose taxes!,5
You're playing one hell of a game,4
Checkmate! Now game two... this time for the taxes thing.,5

I’ve been dying to try this move.,8
And everyone said you couldn’t be beaten!,34
This is the last time we play a sudden death match!,20
I told you I would cheat Death.,0
"No, no, no. You took your finger off.",12
There IS a God!,-1
Ha! I win . . . ironically in sudden death.,1
"Sorry to cheat, Death.",0
"A simple ""Congratulations!"" without the bony finger would be fine.",12
Can't we just play for FUN sometimes?,4
"Sudden death, mate!",20
"Checkmate, again! I'll see you next year.",-1
It didn't work in The Seventh Seal either.,22
"You were right, the end always comes sooner than you think!",10

"If bishop takes queen,
Death takes Bob.",28
"Caught up in the excitement of the moment, Steve realized it was too late to reconsider.",0
"Okay, let me tell you why that was a bad move.",8

"Ha! I win. Now I am Death, and you have to attend the zoom meeting!",1
Did you really think I'd fall for the Reaper's gambit?,45
Let’s not play a game that can end in sudden death.,20

Fine. You win. You can buy Twitter.,-1
We're playing hangman next,-1
"No, I never saw that Swedish movie. Why do you ask?",49

"Closer my friend, there’s one little move I need 
to show you…",-1
Who said I can’t beat death,21
I just hope you're not a sore loser.,40
It’s just a saying - “ you’ll win over my dead body.”,-1
"Sorry, Vlad, that's another win for Ukraine!",88

Impressive end-game. Now let me show you mine.,10
"Ah, yes. You beat me. But you didn't ""listen carefully, as the options may have changed.""",-1
"I did not cheat, Death!",0
And they said I shouldn't watch Queens Gambit while driving!,24
Death comes for the bishop!,28
334 out of 666?,23
Read my lips... you cannot win,43
"I wouldn't take that bishop if I were you, Roger.",28
I’ll accept a draw.,67
"So, what's your exit strategy?",10
"Ha!  It feels good to have cheated death, and you can give me the finger all you want.",0
"It’s just a friendly game, right?",4
You only think you've won!,1
Checkmate!  That's two in a row. Next game do you want to play Sudden Death?,-1
