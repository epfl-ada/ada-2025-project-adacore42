    "## The plan for this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a first tentative of a structure, ideas and methodology on how to analyse gender roles and representation in the New Yorker caption contest. Remember, the idea here is to start simple and then add complexity little by little.\n",
    "\n",
    "0) Start with some basics plots and analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - How often men/women appear in the cartoon ? \n",
    "\n",
    "        a. To recognize if a man/woman is in the picture, the idea is to use the *image_descriptions* and *uncanny_image_descriptions* that are contained in the metadata. Some of the images don't have this metadata, this is a problem for later where I'll need to find a way to add a description to the images that don't have one. Or find an model that detect men/women in a cartoon.\n",
    "\n",
    "        b. When this is done, I can do several plots. The first being a bar plot with just the distribution of gender over all the cartoons. Then I can plot the evolution of the gender distribution over time, to see if it is constant or not. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - How often men/women are mentionned in the captions ?\n",
    "\n",
    "        I think this is interesting to link this with part 0.a. Are men more mentionned when there is a man in the picture or not, same for woment ? Are men mentionned in the caption even if there are no men in the picture, same for women ? \n",
    "        \n",
    "        c. To do this, I can just find the mention of man/women in the captions. How ? For now, I haven't thought about it, I think we need a kind of list or something that can find word that are gender related maybe ?\n",
    "\n",
    "        d. Same as 0.b, do some plots of the overall contest and then evolution over the years.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Dig in a little deeper: How are men vs women depicted\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Caption Analysis Word Clouds (Andras did that a bit already, try to reuse)\n",
    "        Here the idea is to find gendered terms (e.g., “wife,” “husband,” “boss,” “nurse”) and their cooccurrences, to see if ... ?\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Role Distribution Sankey Diagram: Flow from gender → depicted roles (domestic, professional, heroic, villainous). \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Do captions reinforce stereotypes and does the audience reward or punishes them ? \n",

    "2) Coming soon..."
