"so, you believe your mother was a toaster?",263
did she actually say 'size matters'?,30
is it possible your inadequacy is caused by her being a smart car?,151
i just can't satisfy her the way the suv can.,151
"you say that she made you feel ""used"". think positively - you're ""pre-owned"".",-1
do you think it hurts more because she left you for a big sedan?,-1
"… and then she said, 'it was never about size. but i can't marry someone with zero emissions.'",30
the only thing she wanted was a lyft.,-1
"so, when these women you describe laugh at your size, how does that make you feel?",30
"as a woman i assure you, its performance not size that matters.",30
i feel like no one has any faith in me.,76
"toaster schmoster, you can't blame your mother.",263

"then the clown said, 'i've got quarters, let's load her up.'",151
she said she couldn't handle me and all of my baggage...seriously?!,-1
i can see why you might have exhaust pipe envy. but the ladies will still get a charge out of you.,3

not every woman cares.,3
just because your owner abandoned you for uber doesn't mean she loved you any less.,-1
"yes, we do validate parking… but first i’d like to talk a little more about your relationship with your mother…",-1
but she thinks electric is boring.,-1
"so then she said, ""i can't be with someone who runs on electric and looks like a clown car!""",151
'your issues with your mother-board seem to be intractable...',16
"so, you say your mother was a cargo van?",-1
"look, you were always so self-driven before you met tesla. how did she steer you away?",-1
"and then my mother said: ""so you think you're smart, huh?""",-1
you're not alone. many others have issues with 'my mother the car.',-1
my mother used to say the other cars are only laughing at you because you're smart,-1
i see...so your engine works when she gets in the car but stops once you start driving.,151
you called your mother a worthless oil burner. do you think that is connected to your fear of failing the emissions inspection?,36
"and when your mother would flash her high beams, how would that make you feel?",-1

"as a woman, i can tell you that size doesn't really matter.",30
my mother always said size doesn't matter.,30
"...and then she screamed ""a car needs a psychiatrist like a fish needs a bicycle,"" and stormed out. i think i'm better off without her. would you like a ride home with me after we're done today?",-1
tell me what it was like having a toaster for a mother.,263
my mother says i need more drive,-1
my mother the car. can you describe those episodes again?,-1

tell me more about your mother and head in parking only.,-1
my wife left me for a satellite...how do you think it makes me feel?,-1
you must have heard by now that women say size doesn't matter,30

and she had 8 cameras,-1
just assure her that the economy size gets better mileage.,151
"i still love her, but she just doesn't rev me up like she used to",-1
"the death drive isn't what you think, but we can talk about your mother if you think it would help.",-1
"and when she refused to call you ""electric horseman,"" how did that make you feel?",158
"my girlfriend just doesn't share my self drive, doc.",181
"yes, yes, your owner used to drive a hummer, but the only thing that matters is that you are the car she owns now.",-1
is it because i remind you of your mother?,340
it's not your mother's fault that you are a hatchback.,271
"tell me about your mother, the car!",-1
so how does it make you feel when your mother says you're not that smart?,-1
it all goes back to my uber selfish mother.,-1
"and just how long have you felt that way about your mother, the car?",-1
so she ran off with one much bigger?,85
"grow a mustache,"" she told me, ""you'd get more mileage.",-1
mom always liked gas powered vehicles better than me!,-1
so you say people see you as nothing but weak and feminine and sporting nothing but curves.,3

she's really driving me crazy!,-1
try adjusting your code the next time you tun into her.,-1

"feelings of inadequacy? well, she left me for a tonka truck, so yeah.",-1
i think 'my mother the car' was a tv show.,-1
she told me i was unreliable.,40
and so you think she left you for an uber. how does that make you feel?,-1
"it's all very complicated. she accused me of penis envy while assuring me size didn't matter and, then, suddenly, one day my engine wouldn't start.",30
your poor mother!,-1
"she laughed after i honked and said , 'size matters'..",30
am i wrong to be jealous of her gas guzzling ways?,-1

"so, your mother wanted you to be driverless?",-1
"when i was called a compact, i let it go. then i was introduced as her little foreign number, but when she complained about the size of my trailer hitch, i just had to break it off.",30
so your mother blames you for leaving the family business to become independent?,271
i just wish she would drive once and awhile.,151
how does driving away from the summer of love make you feel?,2
so...she said you're driving her nuts?,-1

are you sure that she was using compact as a euphemism for small?,30
"size matters yes, but what else did she say?",30

"okay, very slowly, give me your phone. i need to send a picture to my sister.",-1

"you see her, too, right?",88
she's a tough act to follow.,-1
should we just go around her?,-1
can we unfollow her?,302
we'd be lost without her.,-1
think she's into a mirage a trois?,133
she'd better be worth it.,-1
at least she got us off the desert island cartoon.,-1
do you think she'd go for a mirage a trois?,133
"believe me, her finale is worth it!",-1
i still can't see up her skirt.,8
i'm starting to think she might just be leading us on.,-1
a twenty says she's lost.,-1
maybe she's been leading us on?,301
following her on facebook was easier.,-1
i also follow her on social media .,329

she promised me low taxes and no immigrants,-1
"no, she's not with me, i thought she was with you.",320
i thought she was with you.,-1
without her we'd be nowhere,-1
she has more followers than we do.,-1
i'm hoping it will rain on her parade,67
i hope it rains on her parade.,67
i think she's leading you on.,-1
it'll be worth it just to see the look on her face when she realizes the band went the other way.,43
i used to wonder around aimlessly until she came along.,-1
you think she knows there's only two of us left?,119
"if she were my mirage, she would be naked.",133
"of course it's a mirage, but she seems to know where she's going.",133
give it up phil. if she hasn't noticed you by now...,119

"""ever get the feeling that she might be just leading us on?''",-1
"ok, so she can read music. i still say she can't read a map.",-1
"if we're just imagining her, does that make us sexist?",-1
i assumed you knew her.,-1
i said i'd follow her to the ends of the earth. i think we're almost there.,-1
i wasn't following her. i was following you.,301
sad. she's obviously hallucinating. not a band in sight.,43
i'm dying for it to rain on her parade.,67
see...i told you she's not wearing any.,8
i can't believe she hasn't noticed us yet...,-1
i’m really hoping it rains on her parade.,67
let's just follow her on instagram from here!,329
i know she's not really there. i just love parades.,67
i can't remember. is she your mirage or mine?,133
she got decommissioned after leading her band into the potomac.,43
seventy-six perfectly sensible trombonists and we had to follow her.,-1

she plans to make death valley great again.,-1
what if she's lost?,-1
she's a showgirl from the mirage.,133
i'm beginning to think she's also lost.,-1
just think where we'd be without her,-1
are you sure she has a sister?,11
is it possible she's lost too?,-1
"she has the pomp, but i wonder if she understands the circumstance.",-1
she's probably just a mirage-erette.,133
"as mirages go, she ranks right up there close to water.",133
"this won't end well, but the fact she stayed in character the entire time is really impressive.",-1
our only hope is for someone to rain on her parade.,67
she calls it the baton death march.,-1
when she stops we stand up and form the word ohio.,-1
i thought she said follow me for dessert.,-1
"she doesn't know, does she?",-1
i hope it rains on her parade.,67
i'm kind of hoping it'll rain on her parade.,67
i thought she said come this way for dessert,-1
"i'm as surprised as you are, but she's really given my life direction.",-1
"until now...i thought ""i'd follow her to the end of the earth"" was just an expression.",-1
"of course she's real, where would we be without her?",-1
it's not a mirage. she isn't wearing underwear.,133
"she goes high, we go low.",-1
i thought you knew her!,-1
"okay, i grant you that the lake was a mirage, the starbucks was a mirage, the macdonald's and the chipotle were mirages, but i swear she winked at me.",15
she's hot.,-1
"not long ago, i followed another strong, confident woman who claimed to know where she was headed ... and it turned out pretty much like this.",-1
maybe it will rain on her parade.,67
"if you can see her too, i think we have a chance.",-1
she just keeps getting hotter and hotter.,-1
i wish she'd stop and ask for directions.,-1
"she's not much on direction, but you can't beat her enthusiasm",-1
how much further before we tell her the rest of the band is dead.,43
"funny thing is, in high school she wouldn't give me the time of day.",-1
what's the downside if we stop following her?,301
"keep following her. where there is a drum major, there is a large cooler of gatorade.",43
"she's lost too, but you have to give her style points",-1
"i can't decide what's worse — that she's leading us to our doom, or that she's been behind the beat for the last ten miles.""",-1
either she's deaf or we're dumb.,-1
i wish somebody would rain on her parade!,67
i'm with her!,320
you want to tell her she's lost or should i?,-1
thank heaven for doris. i would have given up by now.,68
at least she's spunkier than the bagpipe player we had last week.,43
thanks again for coming; this really means a lot to katie and me.,337
she certainly looked like she knew where she was going!,-1
"mirage? no, i'm following her because she's got the same voice as my gps.",133
"i'd ask her, but i've only just started seeing her.",-1
"keep an open mind, she says she can bring us jobs...",105
i hope it rains on her parade _ soon!,67
"i'm telling you, she's a drum miragette.",133
"well, she is 97% water.",93
"oh, give her a break. it's her first day.",198
do you ever get the feeling we put too much faith in the system?,76
"i've been thinking, she probably should have made a left on 59th street.",-1
"mirage? no, i think she's from the bellagio.",133
"remind me again why she couldn't just ""tell"" us how to get there??",-1
is it wrong to hope that it rains on her parade?,67
i think she's leading you on.,-1
an hour ago i would have sworn she was a camel!,-1
i can see up her skirt.,8
that's it for me. no more chasing women.,3
"oh no, i was crawling long before she showed up.",-1
she's really more of a 'fantasy' than a 'mirage.',133
may it rain on her parade!,67
"are you sure she can get us ""hamilton"" tickets?",-1
"you know, it's not sexist to ask her if she's sure this is the right way.",119
she's always been an optimist.,-1
maybe it will rain on her parade.,67
"""when i started following she was a clydesdale pulling a beer wagon.""i",-1
"i'd say she's a few trombones short of 76, wouldn't you?",-1
i think that for a mirage she keeps cadence quite well.,133
i hope this mirage knows where's she going!,133
keep following. she's the new secretary of the interior,239
i follow her on twitter also,329
"hallucination or not, she's got spirit.",-1
"i know she's only a mirage, but what else have we got?",133
"she knows we're here, right?",119
funny...a second ago she was wearing underpants.,8
i still can't tell if she's wearing panties.,8
"is it just me, or is she actually picking up the pace?",-1
she has a lousy sense of direction but i'd follow those legs anywhere.,-1
i thought we were following her only on facebook.,301
"and, you're sure she winked at us during the game.",153
"in your mirage, is she blonde or brunette?",-1
is she your mirage or mine?,133
forget the water. i want her optimism.,93
i agree she's attractive and has lots of energy but i'm starting to think she's not that smart.,-1
i'd follow her anywhere.,301
she motivates me to go the extra mile.,-1
i was waiting for godot and she came along.,-1
maybe it'll finally rain on her parade.,67
ask her to spin that baton. we might get a breeze.,-1
"be patient, she's getting us seats right on the field.",-1
"me? i said i'd follow her to the ends of the earth, and she said, ""ok, let's go."" you?",-1
you would think she'd notice that 74 trombone players have been eaten by jackals.,-1
"i'm telling you, her invitation didn't say desert, it said dessert.",-1
i guess i really would follow her anywhere.,301
she's taken us in a whole new direction.,-1
her favorite after-school activites are band and cross country.,43
i'd like to walk a mile in her shoes.,35
she did so well in the polls...,5
i want to see her face when she turns around!,-1
"she looks fantastic, but sometimes i question her leadership.",-1
i sure hope she knows where she's going. we left the rose bowl two days ago.,-1
"well, at least she's still more accurate than apple maps.",-1
stop me if you think i'm wrong but i think she is out of step with reality.,-1
wish she'd ask directions.,-1
"i told stella i would follow her to the ends of the earth, but i didn't think there would be a test.",-1
i think she’s lost,-1
how long are we going to play along before we have to take grandma back to the nursing home?,14
"you gotta admit, she's one hell of a motivator.",-1
c'mon. talk to her already...,-1
"no, the bet's still on. she'll drop it next time.",-1
how could she not know the way to macy's.,67
i'm waiting for it to rain on her parade.,67
"so if she's just a mirage, why are we following her?",133
she's a tall glass of water all right,93
at least she stopped running.,-1
"as mirages go, she's pretty perky.",133
now i see it. she is bending her right knee too much.,-1
"if this is what it took to get us talking again, then i say she's worth every penny.",-1
she makes it seem all so worthwhile.,-1
i told you it never rains on her parade.,67
"no, she really has hamilton tickets.",-1
"we're still with her, right?",320
"so, you finally get it that she's been leading both of us on all along.",-1
i think you should tell her those last two turns were a little unnecessary...,339
you said she'd lead us to the promised band.,43
i'm hoping it will rain on her parade,67
that's no illusion. that's my wife.,0
she's hearing a different drummer.,43
"easy for her, she didn't start out carrying a tuba.",-1
"i said i would follow her anywhere, in sickness and in health. why are you here?",301
i wonder if she realizes we gave up our tubas miles ago.,-1
but she looked like she knew where she was going,-1
you tell her the election is over!,5
"yeah, you're right! she's not wearing underwear.",8
did she say mirage or ménage?,133
she says she is going to make america great again.,5
so when is it gonna rain on her parade already?,67
"ya know, i'm not sure where she appeared from but she promised manufacturing jobs so i'm feeling pretty optimistic about where we're headed!",-1
i think women are natural leaders.,3
if we both see her? then we're dead. or on hbo.,-1
we should follow her on twitter.,329
i lost all confidence in her when the trombones died.,-1
i'd follow her anywhere.,301
i get the feeling she's leading us to a major disappointment.,301
there was just something about her brash confidence that inspired me to follow.,88
i'm beginning to think she's never even heard of macy's.,67
her tinder said she likes long walks...,-1
"so she gets into this costume and says to me, 'come on, honey. i'll take you down a road not-travelled by. bring a friend.' any more questions?",151
i'm still with her!,320
our dry humor keeps her going.,246
"she obviously doesn't know where she is going, but you have to admire her enthusiasm!",-1
when should we tell her she lost the band?,43
"well, i guess it never rained on her parade...",67
what do you mean you saw her first?,-1
i think we can go home now. if she hasn't dropped it yet she probably won't.,-1
'think she knows she has a run in her pantyhose?,8
your girlfriend is so upbeat.,-1
so this is what following her to the end of the earth is.,-1
i’m starting to think she doesn’t want to go to homecoming with either of us.,-1
"i said i would follow her to the ends of the earth. you, too?",-1
i love a woman in a uniform.,8
at what point are we not with her?,-1
and to think an hour ago we were at a spa sipping mojitos; she's good--she's very good.,-1
appears that hillary's following thinned out after the election,5
your wife's a real trooper.,0
well if she's a mirage how do you explain the marching band?,133
i think she’s lost,-1
what if it turns out she is just a cactus?,-1
when the hell is she gonna pass the baton?,-1
you have to get passed her.,-1
i'm beginning to think that she is a miragerette.,133
i'd like to rain on her parade.,67
she still thinks hillary is going to win.,5
"she got us into this, and she can get us out.",-1
i believed her when she said it always rained on her parade. now what?,67
i love the way she splashes through the mirages.,133
"remember, she can't make us drink.",93
i like to see a woman exhibiting leadership qualities.,-1
i'm still with her!,320
it's not my fault. i thought she said we were going for desert.,-1
"oh yeah, i'm still with her.",320
i'm here because she promises to create jobs.,105
her workout sessions really make you feel the burn.,-1
i'm not sure her enthusiasm makes up for her lack of topographical expertise.,-1
i hear she's one of the top picks for secretary of transportation.,-1
"mirage or not, if she drops the baton she'll have to bend over to pick it up.",133
ask her if she takes requests.,119
"she might have a lousy sense of direction, but just look at those thighs!",-1
"no, you tell her the last of the marching band died off five miles back.",43
i like her confidence.,-1
how drunk were we when we promised to follow her to the ends of the earth?,93
i'm beginning to think she's a mirage.,133
she'll ask for directions.,-1
i just wish she'd change the tempo.,43
"rain on her parade...rain on her parade, enough already!",67
is she taking the long way?,-1
when do you think she’ll realize that everyone else is dead?,-1
"i knew climate change would impact the rose parade, but this is ridiculous.",29
"maybe she's taking this ""road less traveled"" thing too far?",-1
could be worse. she could be wearing boxers.,8
"she may be a mirage, but she’s a damn good mirage.",133
she said the football game is just around the next dune.,-1
maybe someone will rain on her parade.,67
do you think she knows we're desperate?,-1
her enthusiasm is really catching.,88
i am beginning to suspect she might be marching to a different drummer.,43
you sure she said rosebowl?,29
"""i'm with her"" hasn't been working out so well.",320
wait til she notices we dropped our tubas a couple of miles back.,-1
"wait a minute, did she ever say specifically how she plans to march america great again?",5
i'd follow a woman in boots anywhere!,301
she sure knows how to boost morale.,-1
you meant it - her legs are to die for.,-1
and if she could march in a straight line she'd be perfect.,-1
i've always admired women in uniform.,8
please tell me again just why we're following her.,301
every once in a while she drops it.,-1
for an extra forty dollars she came with my gps.,-1
i hope she's leading us to water and not salted peanuts.,-1
mirage or no mirage; she's a tall drink of water. that's good enough for me.,133
"i know she's just a mirage, but she keeps impeccable timing.",133
"maybe she is a mirage, but it sure takes your mind off being thirsty.",93
but would you also swim the deepest ocean for her?,330
"she's good, but this music is fantastic.",43
i must admit i was a little suspicious when she wanted us to join her for a drink,-1
she's a lot more attractive than our last gps system.,-1
"she was very fairly elected to be our drum major, now just give her a chance.",43
i almost lost her at the last stoplight.,-1
she's making the desert great again.,-1
i bet she doesn't realize how ridiculous she looks.,-1
it's worth it on the off-chance she's not a mirage.,133
when is she going to pass the baton?,-1
"just you remember, she'll make arizona great again.",5
at least she's not making us spell out ohio.,-1
"i know she's not real, but the heels are a nice touch",35
i'm hoping she's headed for river city.,-1
"seriously bro, i think she's over you.",-1
i wish she was waving a divining rod instead of a baton.,-1
are you sure she said this was the road less traveled?,-1
her last gig was at the mirage in vegas.,133
does she even know we got a crush on her?,119
guess who she voted for?,5
she’s my kind of gal. she refuses to stop and ask for directions.,-1
should we tell her we should have turned left at the gas station?,-1
"these footprints seem freshly made, we can't be far behind her now!",35
she's great! we already covered 5 miles since she joined us!,-1
"""blow in my ear and i'll follow you anywhere"", i told her. you, too?",-1
i replaced her baton with a rainstick. just watch.,-1
how can she walk in those heels?,35
"i'm telling you, it's bound to rain on her parade eventually.",67
we waited too long -- it'll be awkward if we tell her what happened to the rest of the band now.,43
is peeking under her skirt worth it?,8
when do we break it to her that i dropped my tuba and you dropped your trombone 27 miles ago?,-1
she promised to take me to las vegas--and you?,-1
who told you that it would rain on her parade?,67
it was either her now or godot whenever....,-1
you have to admire her perseverance.,-1
she can lead us to water but she can't make us drink.,93
"i told her if she went commando, i'd follow her anywhere!",8
"on the bright side, she's less annoying than a tiger on a boat.",15
when we passed the oasis she just came darting out of the palm trees.,-1
"she marches to the beat of a different, drier, drummer",43
think she could drum up a cold one?,-1
"you know, majorettes originated in the rhineland, where young women performing at carnivals were called ""tanzmariechen"" or dance mary's. really interesting, huh?",129
how do we explain this to our wives?,0
it's her boots ... they are really made for walking.,35
does she realize halftime was 5 days ago?,-1
this really wasn't what i had in mind when she said she'd lead us to the nearest watering hole.,93
i thought she'd pass the baton by now.,-1
she's a female leader i felt i could really get behind.,-1
i didn't want to say anything but i think she lost the beat back there where the buzzards ate the last of the percussion section.,43
your wife sure is a good sport about this!,0
she had beans last night.,-1
"if she weren't a mirage, she'd be marching in a straight line wouldn't she?",133
she's a lot better looking than that stupid bunny with the battery.,106
"she does know how thirsty we are, right ?",93
we can't ask her anything. she's got the talking stick.,208
i was sure she'd lead us right to macy's.,67
where are the 76 trombones she promised?,-1
i guess following her blindly into oblivion wasn't such a great idea.,301
"hear me out: there's no dorothy, no toto, no yellow bricks... i think we're in the wrong gig.",61
hey... she avoided those rocks didn't she?,-1
march! march!march! just one time i'd like to see her throw that damn thing in the air and catch it.,67
didn't she just miss a beat?,43
should we tell her we lost our instruments about two miles back?,-1
the good news...she doesn't know we are here.,-1
"""'ya gotta admit, she has a nice butt"".",85
according to media reports she's leading a large band.,43
if she's a mirage how come she knows every sousa march?,133
"i didn't vote for her, but she is a highly effective leader.",5
she's taking us to hilary's victory party - she won the popular vote.,5
"it's not a mirage, my wife always takes the lead.",0
i'd hate to walk 1000 miles in her shoes.,35
marches have gotten much more interesting since the foreign legion started accepting women.,-1
"is it me, or she hard to follow?",-1
she’s my mirage. you dream up the band.,133
should we tell her we lost the elephant 12 miles ago?,240
perhaps hillary was more qualified after all.,5
crawl to the beat or she'll make us start over.,-1
"trust me, she's real.",88
i forget. is she our carrot or our stick?,18
"well, you must admit she has a certain ""je ne sais quoi""!",-1
are you sure that's a divining rod she's carrying,-1
she's leading us to the source of accurate news.,-1
at some point she's gotta pass the baton!,-1
"i take her seriously, but not literally.",40
i'll follow a woman in a uniform anywhere.,-1
i told you i would follow her anywhere.,301
i'm with her!,320
"i know it's a death march, but aren't you curious if she drops the baton at the end?",-1
she won't be happy till our arms are in synch,-1
maybe we shouldn't have followed hillary!,5
you really have to appreciate her enthusiasm.,88
"i'm feeling it, i tell you. she's leading us to the promised land.",-1
"i'm tellin' ya, the longer we wait the funnier the look on her face will be.",-1
"this is going nowhere, let's eat her !",9
i told you we should have followed that turkey balloon instead of her.,-1
maybe this is why she got drummed out of town.,43
anyway her enthusiasm is inspirational,88
are you sure she knows the way to the oasis?,-1
what if she's a mirage leading us to a mirage?,133
she won't stop until the band is back together.,43
i wish she'd let us twirl the baton once in a while.,-1
"if we're going to follow her, can't you at least crawl at the right rhythm?",-1
i thought her enthusiasm was supposed to be infectious.,88
my wife suffers from water retention.,-1
now she shows up!,-1
i'm beginning to think she's a little off key.,-1
we follow her to the sideline and then it's gatorade!,93
"yes, i'm still with her.",320
"she might be a mirage, but she knows where she's going.",133
she seems to know where we`re going,-1
"sure she has a cute rear end, but this is getting ridiculous.",-1
does she know that we want it to rain on her parade?,67
my commitment to follow her anywhere is wearing thin.,301
"no, really, she's better than a gps.",-1
we need to keep following her. she's the drum major for the niagara falls high school band.,43
"all in all, i say she's the best mirage we've seen yet.",133
do you think she has noticed us yet ?,-1
"jeez, can't she do anything slower than 2/2 time?",-1
she's making the desert great again.,-1
do you think we can talk her into using that stick as a dowsing rod,-1
i think her candidacy led us astray,5
"she blew in my ear, and you?",-1
do you think she'll notice we're out of step?,-1
but would she follow you anywhere?,-1
"yeah? well, i think she's a lousy water diviner.",93
"when you said you'd follow her anywhere, did you have any idea?",301
she gave the signal for allegro. quicken the pace.,-1
"me? i started in high school, and i think i'll be at first base with her soon.",-1
i am starting to think she was over-confident.,88
we have to stand up. she started singing the star spangled banner.,43
doreen is a natural leader. she just has to improve her situational awareness.,-1
who got her a fitbit?,-1
who cares if she's lying about the waterfall and the oasis - she's a great leader.,-1
it's not easy being a hillary cheerleader.,-1
i warned you that she marched to the beat of a distant drummer!,43
she promised to get us there by opening kickoff!!!,-1
and you had to go and mouth off about her lack of stamina!,-1
can you believe she got cut from cross country?,-1
she can lead us to water but she can't make us drink.,93
she works at the mirage.,133
she makes me feel guilty for putting down my tuba.,-1
see! i told you she is wearing panties.,8
"yessir, i'd go to the ends of the earth for her.",-1
the rest of the band deserted her miles ago.,43
her band has deserted her,43
i think your wife is mocking us.,0
she says her last gig was shepherding a cadre of lemmings.,43
i think her last name is pelosi.,5
it must be her pheromones.,-1
i'll stand up when she sings the national anthem.,43
she's always marched to a different drummer.,43
you'd think she would have noticed when the band stopped playing.,43
does she know she veered off the parade route?,67
we said we’d follow her anywhere.,301
so your line in the sand is if she asked you to jump off a bridge?,-1
"to me, she sure looks like one long drink of water.",93
"i told you, her legs take you places",-1
did she say she was a drum major or a drum mirage?,43
i'm beginning to think she's a mirage.,133
"we've come this far, we can't desert her now.",-1
"drum major or drum mirage, she got us this far...",43
"you know, she's beginning to look like major-eat.",-1
did she say 76 trombones or 76 miles?,-1
why are we following her again?,301
she must do crossfit.,-1
you've got to admit her leadership qualities really are second to none.,-1
"if it wasn't for her, i'm sure we'd be out of step by now...",-1
are you sure she's a dominatrix?,-1
"she did say simon says, didn't she?",-1
should we tell her that we already passed our house?,222
i hear she's married to a tall drink of water,93
there's just something about the way she moves.,-1
she comes with alumni parking.,-1
she lied about stopping in pasadena.,-1
of course she's nuts. but she does have an aura of certainty i find very appealing in these uncertain times.,-1
i'm beginning to have my doubts that she is a water dowser.,93
she has a lousy sense of direction.,-1
she either has superb balance--or her battery's run out.,-1
"did she blow in your ear, too?",-1
"sometimes, i really wonder if she knows where she's going.",-1
no peeking if she drops the baton,-1
"good girl, lassie, good girl!! (didn't she have four legs this morning?)",139
"follow her,"" you said. ""she knows where to go.",-1
macy's parade?! i think her gps turned off at madison avenue!,67
in a better hallucination she'd be holding a divining rod!,-1
"she may be just a mirage, but i'd follow those legs anywhere.",133
she must be running on duracell's.,-1
when can we say we've given her enough of a chance?,-1
do you think she really knows the way?,-1
"ok, double or nothing says she drops that baton in the next hour.",-1
how much longer are you going to keep following hillary for ?,5
are you sure she's leading us to water?,93
"if you think she knows where she’s going, where’s the rest of her band?",43
i thought she was gonna stop at the edge of town.,-1
make her rain on this parade.,67
"yes, i know she's crazy, but i still say she marches to the beat of her own drummer.",43
what is it about women with batons that makes me grovel?,-1
i'm beginning to think she is just a mirage!,133
she marches to a different drummer.,43
she will have to stop when we reach the horizon.,-1
"she puts the ""star"" in starvation.",-1
she seemed so confident...,88
she's gotta be from the baton death marching band.,43
is she wearing thongs in your hallucination too?,8
think she can really lead us to starbucks?,-1
she said she knew where there was an oasis.,-1
with those thighs i'd follow her anywhere.,301
she said it gets easier when the seasons change.,-1
she's going to make america great again.,5
"somehow i'm not thirsty anymore. i told you, nobody rains on her parade!",67
"she's cute, but this isn't the parade route",67
i hear she's besties with the energizer bunny.,106
she's marching to the sound of a different drummer,43
this is not what she had in mind for her inaugural parade.,67
i've been following her since the 2012 thanksgiving day parade.,67
by the time we get to phoenix she’ll be crawling…la di dah dah...,277
"she's the leader, and we're her parching band...",43
"follow her. pasadena, new year's day. guaranteed.",-1
"i'm tired, hungry and thirsty, but just look at her twirl!",93
"back off, she's mine.",-1
you'll have to excuse her. my mother's a little dramatic about everything.,-1
remember. we promised to follow her to the ends of the earth,-1
she makes me feel alive again.,-1
"maybe she can-can, but i can't-can't.",-1
do you think if we keep following her we'll find the tailgate parties?,5
keep going . . . she promised us a part in the macy's parade.,67
please tell me she knows where the water is.,93
"yes, she is fun to follow but there are limits!",-1
told you not to follow hillary.,5
"no idea, but wherever it is she'll make a great first impression.",-1
so when did she say she gets her water break again?,93
"her name is marian. i hope we're headed for river city, where she ran the library.",-1
"no, wait until we get to rockefeller center. she'll never see us escape through all those people.",-1
she hardly sweats at all,-1
and she looks so real.,-1
"i have a good feeling about this. before long, she'll lead us right to macy's.",67
she's been trying to log more steps on fitbit,-1
"yeah, i could follow her for 40 years.",-1
i'm beginning to think we should have stopped following her at that last town.,301
"find your own random marching woman in the desert to crawl after, you glory seeking bastard.",-1
you gotta love her enthusiasm !,-1
are you sure that this is the way to the rose parade?,29
"she's got gorgeous gams, that's why.",-1
i think she's confused my pounding heart and wheezing for a drum and a bagpipe.,43
"she's as lost as we are, but i choose to follow her out of bitterness and frustration.",-1
"back when the parade first started, she said her name is hillary.",5
no wonder why it never rains on her parade.,67
so what if she's a mirage? i've always been a sucker for a parade.,133
i wish she'd stop long enough for me to ask for her phone number.,-1
she's from ohio state,-1
are you sure that's a dowsing rod she's carrying?,-1
"did she blow in your ear, too?",-1
what if she doesn't know the territory?,-1
"keep it up! i heard that at mile three, she starts scattering candy!",-1
i wish she'd just give us some hint of which of us she prefers!,-1
so far it doesn't rain on her parade.,67
...and she's going to build a wall and make muslims register and get us our jobs back and make sure we get clean drinking water!,5
do you think she'll get us there for the halftime show?,-1
"most days, i'm glad that she's still out here, front-&-center - but then, i sometimes really miss the tuba section, and the drums...",43
how the hell does she keep marching along in high heel boots?,35
her leadership skills were a mirage after all.,133
"i know it is a fantasy, but i just can't keep my eyes off her.",-1
she's going to make america great again.,5
i can't believe she's real this time.,88
i think she' leading us to trumpland,-1
i'm starting to think she doesn't have a clue where the end of the parade route is.,67
"i'd prefer if she just said, ""i told you so.""",40
what?! i thought you said she was a 'sand'leader.,-1
"i have to give it to her, she maintains good form.",-1
"i guess she hasn't showered, either.",-1
"i'm banking that she will get thirsty at some point, or another.",93
"if she is a mirage, why does her uniform smell so bad?",133
boots. short skirt. authority. catchy beat. i'd follow her anywhere.,301
she almost makes dying of thirst fun.,93
"we were at halftime of the greatest football game ever, and now we're here. she's good--she's very good.",-1
she's like this until it snows,-1
"sure she's a hallucination, but whenever she led the band it rained.",43
"uh-oh, i can hear the different drummer she's marching to.",43
"she had me, with just one twirl, at mile one.",-1
she is the very model of modern majorette.,-1
i told you she has no sense of direction!,-1
i really think hillary still has a chance!,5
"just remember, when we get through this, we'll make more than she does.",-1
she's the top-rated personal trainer in albuquerque,-1
pretty soon it's gonna rain on her parade.,67
what's her secret?,86
"when the band disappeared, we should have figured she's what's left of the mirage.",43
may it rain on her parade!,67
i'm happy she finally decided on her major.,-1
"her routine is a wee long, but i give her high marks for poise and commanding her audience.",-1
no. we tried the 'following hillary blindly' thing and it didn't work then either.,5
her cateen must have had electrolytes.,22
she's all attitude.,88
she walks to the beat of a different drummer.,43
"she's incredible, the other 98 band members died 200 miles ago.",43
marching to a different drummer has always distinguished her from the crowd.,43
"well, what exactly did you think it would be like to follow a baton death marching band on its summer tour?",-1
she doesn't look thirsty.,93
i do admire how she keeps a beat.,43
i still say she has a nice rear end.,-1
she's sure to tire eventually.,345
"hey, i just saw her underpants.""",8
who cares if she's missing the beat?,43
when is she going to lead you to drink?,281
there's just something trumpian about her.,88
are you sure she's not a mirage?,133
she said we could keep our doctor.,-1
i like her spunk.,-1
i hope she makes us spell out something cool in the sand.,-1
see . . . i told you she wasn't wearing any underwear!,8
she's just like us.,-1
she's too old for a mirage.,133
i thought she'd stop when i ditched the glockenspiel.,-1
she is going to be so disappointed,-1
she is so damned followable.,301
why are we following her again?,301
i never want hillary's victory parade to end.,67
she seems to know where she's going!,-1
i guess women do have more stamina.,3
"""rommel's granddaughter"".",87
"'i'm with her, but i think we should have stayed longer in the midwest.",320
"i'm not sure where she's taking us but she can sure carry a tune, huh?",43
the competition for drum major is out of hand. let's give it to her.,43
we´ve crawled a mile for one of her smiles.,348
"her positive thinking is admirable, but this is the third time she's led us past this same spot.",-1
"and then she said, ""i think we should take separate vacations "".",-1
"she's headed somewhere and we were lost, so why not follow her.",301
i love a woman who marches to the beat of her own drummer.,43
"''so who told her that this was a short cut back to macy's""",67
"her march may be our crawl, but the important thing is that we're all getting our tuition paid for.",-1
just hope she doesn't hit the wall.,-1
you sure she's not a miragette?,133
and you were worried she would lead us into a dead end!,-1
i'm beginning to think she may be a robot.,-1
yes i do think she should run for a fourth term.,5
are you sure she knows the way to pretoria?,-1
forget what she said. she's can't remember the parade route either.,67
pinch her behind see if she minds.,229
are you sure this is the way to the rose bowl?,29
mirage- she said her name is!,133
she told me we were playing follow the leader.,-1
"i've been the 'band' for the last 5 hours. now it's your turn. and make a smoother transition this time, so she doesn't notice.",43
let's ditch her at el paso and duck into sammy's for a drink.,-1
"i thought she was saying ""life's a beach""",-1
she said she was from macy's.,67
i promised her she could be in the halftime show.,-1
she's always marched to her own drummer.,43
her high step and costume are nice but i really like her sense of direction.,-1
she's marching to the beat of a drummer we need to find.,43
at least she's not twirling fire.,201
and you said she wouldn't get past the city limit.,-1
it's been better since she got rid of the cymbals.,-1
i'm glad we gave her the rest of the water.,93
"this is unreal, she's actually humming the stars and stripes forever.",-1
she marches to a different drummer.,43
we'd be sunk if she'd ended up as a cheerleader.,-1
think she's playing lost compass?,-1
"i told you ""blind faith"" never does any good",76
she marches to the beat of a different drummer.,43
i could swear she was wearing a pantsuit when we started!,8
now she wants to go to iowa!,-1
"i heard she gets paid more than us."" ""yeah, i heard she's an illegal immigrant from syria with a transgender partner"" ""i wouldn't want the job. having to smile all the time. i have to be myself."" ""at the end of the day, we're all fucked"" ""true",-1
''it's been 40 years since she parted the sea. do you think we're still on target for that pot of gold?'',93
i told you she has stamina.,-1
she's a very determined young lady.,-1
"i know we told her we'd follow her anywhere, but this is getting ridiculous.",301
"trust me on this, our loyalty will be rewarded when the rest of the crowd realizes she is on the right track.",-1
"okay, i think we did it. we beat the band. you tell her.",43
"on the flip side, watching her butt wiggle makes it sorta fun.",-1
i'm really attracted to the fact that she marches to the beat of her own drum.,43
i just had this nagging thought that she might be a mirage.,133
after that last curve i'm beginning to doubt she's on the hunt for water...,93
i never can resist her siren song.,-1
she thinks she hears a different drummer.,43
im only following because she promised water,93
why did you have to tell her that her white cane is a baton?,-1
"she's so upbeat, i'd follow her anywhere.",301
she's one hell of a sand leader,-1
should we tell her thanksgiving is over?,-1
"a plan to lead us out of despair, a relentlessly upbeat persona--and killer legs, to boot; now this is your first female president of the united states!",5
"someone should tell her that, as a rule of thumb, shorter, more frequent breaks work better than infrequent, longer breaks.",49
is this your mirage or mine? and will she lead us to water?,133
i warned you not to get her a step tracker.,-1
it must've rained on her parade...,67
"does she know where we're going, or is she leading us astray?",-1
what if she's a robot?,-1
i hope her gps system is working.,-1
i love it when she tortures us with all this zigging and zagging.,-1
"submit what they will, those captions should all boil down to, ""i hate her.""",-1
she promised gatorade once halftime ends.,-1
she's georgia o'keefe's daughter.,71
i just remembered martha wanted me to bring a ham home this evening.,24
"you know, of course, we'll have to drink her bodily fluids to survive..",93
when will she pass the baton?,-1
her cup is half full.,93
"have faith. she's cheer leader, rain dancer, water diviner all rolled into one!",67
"ok, who told you she could do a rain dance?",67
if we stay close to her we won't get run over by the band.,43
"no matter what, i'm still with her!",320
remember? yesterday she had on riding boots!,-1
she promise you drumsticks too?,43
what's in her energy drink?,-1
she said she knew the way to macy's and who are we to doubt her?,67
she seemed really confident about heading this way.,88
still think she knows where the waterhole is?,93
no doubt we've both fallen for her.,-1
this is every bit as good as her tweets!,329
she knows where water is,93
i think that she is leading us from one ex-stream to another.,-1
"actually, i still prefer deuces wild to follow the queen.",1
"i dropped my kazoo. you'll have to take over the next time she says, ""strike up the band.""",-1
she clearly marches to her own drum beat.,43
"yeah - hot weather, and women in skirts. its still not exactly my idea of a march vacation.",2
just keep following. it's her turn.,339
she's practising for trumps inauguration parade. do you got any tic tacs?,5
"broadway was a 1,000 miles back but she's still as spry as ever.",-1
you're lucky. my wife would never do this.,0
what if she's just leading us to a patriots' game?,-1
she marches to the beat of a different drummer.,43
"for the hundredth time, we're marching. there is no beat. she's no drummer.",43
she had you at the first baton twirl.,-1
"when i'm behind her, i'm impressed!",-1
you swear she's out here divining for water?,93
i thought you said she's leading us to water !,93
with those high struts i was sure she knew the way.,-1
i guess hillary lost her bandwagon,5
"""hey, wait a minute, did she say bataan?'",-1
"at this point, i'd day the heck with the rose bowl!",29
"well, someone needs to tell her that she's not in command of her band.",43
girls with directions...,-1
"she's like the energizer bunny, she keeps going and going!",106
do you still think we should have believed her when she said she knew more about the desert than the camels?,-1
her name is moses. i imagined her for us.,71
you should see her from my side.,88
"i know this didn't work before, but trust me she will make us great again!",5
the bet's off if she trips.,-1
hope she knows where we're going.,-1
what's her secret?,86
she really marches to the beat of her own drummer.,43
"' come on, keep up. she's saying right left right left.'",-1
she says she's from the macy's thanksgiving day parade. all things considered i have my doubts.,67
"band or no band, she looks like she knows where we should go.",43
"yes, she is a strong leader.",-1
i can see my wife from here.,0
she said something about getting away from the noise of the bagpipes and i think she succeeded.,-1
you're absolutely certain she's taking us to water?,93
"once she twirls the baton, we'll look for water.",93
are you sure she knows where the water is?,93
"she promised bread with this circus, right?",-1
"she's never been much of a cook, but she's always been able to life my spirits.",197
how far is the rose bowl?,29
"""marching to a different drummer""...not funny, hal. where is that gold mine she promised?",43
i told you we weren't misogynists. women really can't be trusted.,3
are you sure she's 'knickerless',-1
i keep myself...am i imagining her or is she imagining us?,119
is the last prostitute on earth even a woman?,-1
i swear i heard her say we're only marching as far as astoria.,43
"i would take my turn in the lead, but she won't let me wear the outfit.",8
coach was right...she's not a mirage.,133
at night she will be on all fours too.,-1
palm springs is her white whale.,-1
"nice mirage, but where does she keep the water?",133
it won't be long now - her baton is empty.,-1
"she asked me...and i knew it was a sousaphone, but i called it a tuba. why, what'd you do?",-1
i saw her in a commercial for high fiber cereal.,-1
i'd say she's from a small town that needs new residents.,-1
"she’s only a mirage, but give thanks anyway.",133
"ok, ok, i think we underestimated her in the ""follow me anywhere"" feeling!",301
when she kicks high i can see her panties.,8
"this drum major was supposed to lead us to the rose bowl, instead she is leading us to the cactus bowl.",43
she's definitely on some type of high horse,158
"if she offers me a red bull again, this time i'll take it.",26
hope she's heading for the rose bowl.,-1
"when she turns around, we whip out our kazoos and play superfreak.",-1
who is this woman and why is she leading us from the shores of tripoli?,-1
i am sure she will lead us to the macy's thanksgiving day parade,67
she assured me she was heading to michigan-ohio state.,-1
are you sure she said she was a water dowser!,93
"ironic, that i asked my wife not to rain on my parade.",67
she's from iowa ... and must have made a wrong turn off 34th street.,-1
she's the wal-mart store manager. she keeps promising to open the 3rd register...,-1
i wonder if she believes in karma?,-1
she said she knew a watering hole within walking distance!,93
it's amazing how she keeps in time with no instruments.,-1
"this is the last protest i sign up for, does she know she lost ?",306
the drum major really takes this rose parade thing pretty seriously.,43
where does she get all that energy?,-1
i hope when she joins the band they'll have some water.,93
the bachelorette- sahara nights,129
she hears the drummer...we see the drum majorette!,43
"this is her first time as a drum major, but she's a real whiz at accounting.",43
she swears it's even more fulfilling than a regular marathon.,-1
should we ask her to please straighten it out?,119
she's a walking ad for a gluten free diet.,143
i think she is a drum mirage,133
"she did say yes to the ""wet bar""",93
just because you liked the way she looked didn't mean we had to follow her.,-1
"if you can't help carrying on about her height, at least use a different metaphor.",85
"well look on the bright side. if she doesn't lead us to water at least we got our aerobic exercise in for this week. or ""i'm a real sucker for a woman with leadership qualities.""",93
she's marching to the beat of her own drum we should have turned around long ago.,43
"i divorced her 5 years ago.” “i did, 2 years ago.",-1
"earl, you still 100% sure she's dowsing water with that stick of hers?",93
"hmmm, i thought she said that i could dot the ""i.""",-1
"no,i didn't look up her skirt!!"" ""wonder what's inside that baton?",8
"sure she's composed now, but wait'll she finds out there's only a gender neutral bathroom.",230
"alright, she hasn't figured out we're off course yet. you owe me $50",-1
she misses the old days of the ohio state marching band,43
"when we married, i promised i'd always look up to her for her spunk.",-1
i'd drink the sand if she asked me to!,-1
do you really think she knows where the nearest starbucks is? who cares?!,-1
i'm following her because i am a trumphite! what about you?,-1
she pledges to make our band great again.,43
she said there was going to be an audience.,-1
do you think she'll ever get tire of campaigning?,5
"hope she's marching to the song ""raindrops keep falling on my head""?",67
she says she's headed for pasadena.,-1
must she always parade around like this?,67
"never took you for such a ""funny girl"" fan.",-1
"at the time, she seemed to boost our level of confidence to lead us out.",-1
she also told you to follow her to get a date?,-1
remember last year when she led us over niagara falls?,67
she must march to the beat of a different bum.,43
she told me when they're having the next tryouts for majorette--i'm in. are you?,159
"even though she's not a 10, you should still grab her by the p***y.",-1

"yeah, but hillary's emails.",42
i still feel that i need to date other women.,3
"oh what, like hillary would have been any better?",5
"well, hillary would've been worse.",5
maybe her private email server wasn't so bad after all.,42
....and then the president started mocking kim jong il and i turned off the tv and fell asleep.,129
what's a nice girl like you doing in an apocalypse like this?,225
"how many times do i have to say it, helen? if i could go back and change my vote, i would.",46
but what about her emails?!!,42
all i did was tweet that our neighborhood went 100% for hillary,5
i guess this means your mother won't be staying with us anytime soon.,-1
"okay, okay, i should have voted for her.",5
remember when i said i would not marry you if you were the last woman on earth?,-1
"yeah, but hillary would've been worse.",5
would this be a good week to have your mother visit?,63
"okay, you're right. i should have voted for hillary.",5
hillary would've been worse.,5
i know. i know. but her e-mails . . .,42
will your mother be joining us in our post-apocalyptic life?,-1
yeah but her emails.,42
ok ok hillary was a better choice.,5
my wife and i drove in yesterday for the inauguration.,0

"before you say 'yes' or 'no,' susan, i'd like to remind you that the alternative is human extinction.",-1

so you're the last woman on earth.,-1
but what about hillary's emails?,42
"yeah, but she's just not likable.",88
"sure, but what about her emails?",42
look on the bright side. your mother won't be staying with us for the holidays.,63
"well, at least we didn't elect a woman president.",5
"oh, like she would've been any better.",5
i'm still not voting for a woman as president.,5
but she had that email server...,42
"yeah, but her emails, though...",42
my sister said they still have a tree in cleveland.,-1
"so, sister kathleen, i guess the human race stops here.",11
i still say it would have been worse if hillary had won.,5
"well, it looks like the fat lady has sung.",213
but her email server...,42
"ok, but she lied about her emails!",42
"yeah, but hillary had emails.",42
i still think she shouldn't have used a private server.,42
"sure, but she had an e-mail server!",42
"ha! looks like your mother won't be moving in, after all.",-1
"yeah, but what about her emails?",42
"yeah, but what about her emails?",42
hillary would've been worse.,5
but her e-mails...,42
"homes explode sometime, it's got nothing to with your mother coming to visit.",63
"ok, ok, i shoulda voted for hillary!",5
i still say things would be worse under hillary.,5
i still think hillary would have been worse.,5
but she deleted some emails.,42
but hillary deleted a bunch of emails...,42
should we have voted for hillary?,5
"sure, but what about her emails?",42
i still think her emails were a bigger deal.,42
"i know, i know, for the thousandth time, you voted for her.",5
"i still say, lock her up!",-1
i still say hillary was worse.,5
"and then i remembered what my ex-wife constantly told me - ""never put metal in the microwave!""",-1
"in hindsight, perhaps we should have voted for hillary",5
i blame your mother.,271
"this is kansas, dorothy... what did you expect?",61
still better than hillary.,5
but what about her emails?!!,42
"the timing for your acceptance of a woman president is just a little late, phil.",5
i didn't promise you a rose garden.,29
i guess this means we live with your mother now.,-1
everywhere your mother goes its the same!,-1
my mother always told me you were a homewrecker.,-1
"not even if we were the last two people on earth, huh, carol?",55
"so, i'm guessing your mother won't be coming now?",63
was that necessary - just to keep my mother from visiting?!,63
"bad news, ruth. it's no longer a seller's market.",183
look at the bright side. your mother can't come.,63
"yeah, but hillary was a crook.",5
we should have voted for hillary.,5
"fine -- so my mother's visit was, in fact, the end of the world.",63
this could have happened just as easily if she was president.,5
"well, i still wouldn't have voted for hillary because of her emails.",42
"okay fine, i admit it. i should've voted for her.",5
"no, honey, i still would not vote for hillary.",5
"oh! carol! i feel the earth move under my feet!"" ""oh! neil! i feel the sky tumbling down!",55
"ok, ok... but i still think she lied about her emails.",42
you were right—i should have voted for hillary.,5
"i chase storms helen, it's what i do.",46
so what time is your mother coming?,-1
so you're the last woman on earth.,-1
"i agree her handling of e-mail doesn't seem like that big of a deal, in retrospect.",42
at least hillary clinton isn't president,5
"okay, so maybe i shouldn't have given a damn about hillary's email.",42
i still think it's hillary's fault.,5
maybe i was wrong about the world not coming to an end if we skipped dinner with your sister.,11
"yes, but hillary would have been even worse.",5
your mother seemed to enjoy her visit.,63
but her emails though.,42
"actually, it is the end of the world frances.",-1
"somewhere, hillary clinton is saying, ""i told you so.""",5
i still think she was hiding something in those emails.,42
but she used a private email server!,42
i'm now thinking we should have voted for hillary.,5
"next time, let's not invite your sister.",11
just think how worse it would be if hillary had been elected.,5
but hillary's emails...,42
you can't blame this one on my mother.,271
yeah but her emails.,42
okay! you win! i should have gone with hillary!,5
hillary should have campaigned in wisconsin,5
what's a nice girl like you doing in a post-apocalyptic world like this?,225
okay. now getting back to hillary's e-mails.,42
i *know* you're the last woman on earth. it's a figure of speech!,-1
"yeah, but hillary's emails.",42
"well, i never promised you a rose garden.",29
"okay, okay, okay. maybe, just maybe, hillary would have been better.",5
what's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?,225
still better than hillary.,5
"i slept with her once, four years ago. why are we still talking about this?",-1
"yeah, but think how bad it would've been if she'd won.",5
"yes, but she did have her own email server",42
but hillary had a private email server!,42
"ok, now your mother can't stay with us.",96
i still think hillary shouldn't have had a private email server.,42
"it's been a blast, helen, but i'm outta here!",46
"sure, but she had her own email server",42
"so ""ms. i'm-voting-for-jill-stein,"" happy?",5
we should have voted for hillary.,5
but her e-mails...,42
"but still, her email server.",42
and she deleted those emails!,42
"well, i certainly haven't forgotten about her emails.",42
i'd only heard of the 'scorned woman' effect.,-1
it would have been worse if hillary was elected.,5
i won't admit anything. i still think hillary would have been worse.,5
"so alice, tell me again why building a bomb shelter was the most ridiculous idea you ever heard.",23
"i told you, we should have voted for hillary!",5
we are not going to your mother's.,-1
"i did vote for hillary, honest....",5
why did streep have to open her big mouth?,-1
"your mother had something to do with this, didn't she?",-1
"come on martha, detroit is not that bad.",24
wrong again! i'm the president and you're the first lady!,5
"hell yes, it could be worse. hillary could've won.",5
"yeah, but the other one couldn't keep track of her emails.",42
i meant it when i said i wouldn't marry you even if you were the last woman on earth.,-1
"no, i said i _wouldn't_ marry you if you were the last woman on earth.",-1
"ok margaret, you win.",77
"martha, our relationship is in ruins.",24
"oh yeah, it’s always my fault, isn’t it, martha?",24
i never promised you a rose garden.,29
"you're right, i should have voted for hillary.",5
"fair enough, but on the other hand, she did have her email on a private server.",42
"i take back what i said about the ""last woman on earth"".",-1
"well, i guess your mother was right.",-1
"i know, i know but come on! did you see her emails?",42
"if not apocalypse now, when then, janet, when?",91
"oh yeah, this is still hillary's fault for not getting elected",5
"see, i told you... i'm a woman scorned.",-1
"face it, helen. we're just no good for each other.",46
i still say i'm not going to your mother's.,-1
"emily, i want a divorce.",7
"did i say ""the last woman on earth?""",-1
"besides that, how was the play, mrs. lincoln?",-1

i guess your mother finally has to move out.,96
"well ... one good thing is, your mother's visit is finally over.",63
"i told you, we should have voted for hillary!",5
your mother seemed stressed.,16
it would have been worse with hillary.,5
i should try the insurance adjuster again. her voice mailbox was full last time.,115
you thought i was kidding when i said i would rather be in a real war zone than dinner with your mother!,108
i have a solemn duty to impregnate the most fertile of the remaining women.,-1
if only you’d have let me warn meryl streep to keep quiet.,-1
"yeah, but crooked hillary had a private e-mail server!",42
"'last woman on earth' is just a phrase, janet.",-1
"well...when you're right, you're right...i probably should have voted for hillary!",5
"really june, the whole damn world is gone and you want a divorce? really!",7
"sure, but she used a private email server.",42
"martha, i get your point about your 'scorched earth' approach if we divorce!",24
"who has the greener lawn now, helen?",46
i told you not to let your mother cook.,232
will your mother still be coming to visit?,63
"honest, mother. i didn't do anything.",-1
"with that being said, danielle, will you accept this rose?",29
i still think she would have been worse.,5
"well, aren't you the most beautiful woman in the whole city.",3
it's still better than hillary.,5
"okay, if your mother were still alive, i still wouldn't want to go to her place for thanksgiving.",-1
"yes betty i voted to make america great again, we are still here aren't we!",5
"linda, i think this relationship is getting toxic",54
"but hillary mishandled those e-mails, so... agree to disagree?",42
"do you think i should run for a second term, hillary?",5
"what the hell did you do that for, hillary?",5
i knew i should have voted for hillary,5
"oh, you want to go scorched earth? let's talk about you and your mother's many similarities.",36
"well, at least there's no room for your mother this year.",63
reason number 873 i voted for her.,5
"""open space remodel,"" she said.",154
i asked you not to let your mother come for a visit.,63
"seriously, where would we put your mother?",-1
well?! are you finally willing to go to mother's?,-1
i never promised you a rose garden.,29
just turn around and take a peek mrs. lot.,64
i'm pretty sure this would have been a lot worse if hillary had won.,5
"next time julia, more cherries, less bomba",220
i told you we should move into your mother's basement.,-1
i told you we should have voted for her.,5
"remember when i said ""if you were the only girl left in the world"" ...?",-1
hillary did it.,5
"we got the sun in the morning and the moon at night, doris.",68
"no, i would not marry you even though you are the last woman alive on this planet.",-1
well ... we could always stay with your mother.,96
"you've got to remember to turn off the toaster oven next time, helen.",263
well i voted for hillary.,5
"so, if you would have listened to your mother and married bob brown, none of this would have happened?",-1
"yes, but imagine if it had been her, with those emails!",42
so *now* when's your mother coming to stay?,-1
"okay, so i should have voted for hillary.",5
"what are your plans now, madam secretary?",239
"i told you to not touch the thermostat, brenda.",-1
"after i told her i was leaving her for you, she blew up!",-1
i still say hillary would've been worse.,5
"well, with hillary it would have been even worse.",5
we can pretend we are from the stone age.,31
"woman: you, with your stupid scented candles!",-1
glad your mother only visits once a year.,63
just how long are we going to wait for your mother?,-1
i concede that hillary was the lesser of two evils.,5
you're the one.. who wanted to live next to your mother!,-1
"we'll never save humanity with that attitude, judith.",-1
"homes explode sometime, it's got nothing to with your mother coming to visit.",63
dorothy and toto should be along soon.,61
"yeah, and if she didn't have anything to hide, why did she need her own email server?",42
"so mrs. o'leary, can you explain once again how your cow caused all this?",26
"emma, would you be offended if i said, ""damn!""",-1
"you had to tweet at kim jong-in, ""i double dog dare you!""",129
"i'm standing firm in my ""not if you were the last women on earth"" position.",-1
my mother said this just a taste of what she will do if i actually marry you.,-1
"okay, linda, you win. i'll take the kids.",54
now you tell me your mother canceled her visit.,63
will you be my apocalyptic wife?,-1
"i still say, lock her up!",-1
but she used a private email server!,42
"gail's misuse of ""literally"" when she meant ""figuratively"" ruined her 20th anniversary.",-1
well at least the stone seats we just bought didn't burn...,19
at least hillary isn't using a private email server.,42
i told you we shouldn't let your mother move in with us.,-1
"hell of a honeymoon, doris!",68
mother was right about you.,-1
"yes, but hillary...",5
"what do you mean ""at least now we won't have to eat my mother's cooking?""",232
how many times do i have to say it? hillary was the better candidate.,5
okay maybe i should've voted for her,5
she didn't get into harvard?,202
maybe you're just one of those women whose joy can't be sparked.,3
scorched earth policy ms. conway!,36
"really, sarah? must you lay waste to the countryside every time i'm little late?",120
but just think if hillary had won.,5
"she who smel't it, dealt it.",-1
the realtor said there's been talk of bringing the train line through here. i say we hear her out.,56
... and we can visit the grandchildren in june.,2
i'm still not going to your mother's birthday party.,-1
none of this would've happened if you just got over hillary clinton's emails!,42
"yes, dorothy...i'd say it's a toto loss.",61
"dorothy, i am leaving you.",68
call your mother.,73
"you have to admit, her emails were pretty troubling.",42
"you're right honey, i should have voted for hillary..",5
"all i did was ask ""alexa"" if she wanted play wargames with ""wopr"".",304
you're just saying that because you're bitter that hillary lost.,5
"we still have carrier, martha!",24
"myron, women do not fart.",-1
"i guess we arent in kansas anymore, dorothy!",61
"yeah, but she had that email server.",42
why do i always feel like on the hot seat when we talk about your mother moving in with us?,16
"it's ok, mom--it's called a 'movie set.'",-1
"margaret, it was just a meaningless fling. no need to go ballistic.",77
i never said i objected to moving in with your mother.,-1
you're just like your mother...,107
"no, i'm not sorry i didn't vote for her.",5
i asked you not to invite your mother,-1
"you do remember i said ""i never promised you a rose garden ""?",29
"what!? no! martha, i thought you got us disaster insurance, ..",115
"doris, that's not what i meant by ""something naughty"" !",68

i told you to vote for hillary!,5
"no, emily, this doesn't mean we're going to cancel this year's super bowl party.",-1
"yes, martha, you were right. armageddon insurance was actually not 'outrageous.'",115
"you used to make me feel like the only girl in the world."" ""you are."" ""would it kill you to say it sometimes?",-1
"next time, please tell me your mother is coming over.",-1
"so, ms. smarty pants, still think it was a good idea to get beavis that chemistry set?",-1
"okay, i’ll admit it, it is the end of the world, but i still say she was too weak a candidate to earn my vote.",5
"so, you still won't tell me who she is?",-1
"okay judith, you voted for ""making america great again, now are you satisfied?",5
if you were the only girl in the world...,-1
bernie or bust?! bernie or bust?! goddamnit rose.,5

"but at least we have each other, joan.",137
"like mom always said, ""look like a bomb went off in here.""",-1
it's your mother's fault.,271

"for heavens sake dorothy; i thought we had an understanding that ""the nuclear option"" meant no more meatloaf. ever!",-1
i never promised you a rose garden post honeymoon.,29
i had no choice -- her emails were indefensible.,42
if you had been with her this wouldn't have happened.,-1
"well, here we are diane... moment of truth!",137
"meryl streep, one of the most over-rated actresses in hollywood, doesn't know me but attacked last night at the golden globes. she is a hillary flunky who lost big. i could go on.",-1

"well susan, have you decided on what you want to eat yet?",-1
"if your mother said that about me, i may not talk to her anymore.",16

"not to worry, you'll be a fine first lady after melania.",5
girls are willing to do anything to win an argument,3

"once i accepted she really wasn't coming home, i decided i needed to meet someone new.",-1
"""just bailey's, no barnum"".",164
maybe she just didn't take you seriously.,-1
your wife called. she wants you to pick up a cream pie on the way home.,-1
"orange mop hair, rainbow tutu, big blue grin? yeah, she was here.",-1
maybe she didn't take you seriously.,-1
you should tell her if you're not ready to get serious.,-1
your mom and i begged you to go to a regular college.,48
maybe she's not seeing the real you.,119
she wanted me to tell you she found somebody who takes her seriously.,-1

so when did you first suspect mrs. bozo had eyes for the human cannon ball?,-1
i served with barnum and bailey; you're no barnum or bailey,164
a bailey's on the rocks?,164
when she told me she was screwing a clown i thought she was joking.,151

"you can have my wife, but i'm keeping the dog!",10
you used to laugh when she barked at the vacuum cleaner.,-1

i'd brake for her.,-1
"whoever dot is, i really like her work.",155
"oh, please, every work of art reminds you of your mother.",-1
yep. mom and me. no permission asked. not a penny in royalties.,-1
nobody could model like her. she stopped traffic.,-1
that's my first wife. she got custody.,-1
her work has become more reflective.,-1
"for a moment, i thought it was the ladies' room.",262
stop staring at her ass...,-1
"ah, 'mother and child' by doe vinci.",141
i remember when myrna posed for this. ironic how she died.,-1
what do you think she's trying to get across?,-1
this is weird; i think i went out with her.,-1
"i couldn't get anywhere with her, and now she's a nude model.",-1
"this is a substantial improvement over her ""yield"" period.",-1
she wants big bucks for it.,-1
she finally left me to get the big bucks.,-1
"her ""headlights"" exhibition was breathtaking.",-1
i knew her before she became a model.,-1
"it's a matter of depth perception; is this a mother with child, or is it 2 deer . . .one near and the other far?",-1
"this one is called ""madonna and blitzen.""",141
"you've seen one madonna and child, you've seen them all.",141
see how the child is leading the mother? remarkable insight.,-1
"if i recall, this one is ""madonna and child"" by elk greco.",141
she was always so beautiful in the headlights,-1
"acknowledging single mothers, i like it!",-1
she looks like my first wife,0
this truly captures the plight of the single mother.,-1
i dated her,-1
i still miss mom.,-1
this is her most pedestrian effort yet.,-1
tell me again how mom died.,-1
i just remember her as a dirty double-crosser,-1
i remember. i met her at a stag party.,-1
"i think it's called ""madonna with fawn.""",141
i posed for that picture with your grandma way back in 2014.,14
i didn’t know she had a baby,111
she always has to play the bambi card.,308
i really do miss my mother.,-1
ugh - not another madonna and child!,141
ah. verdeer's madonna and child.,141
she never told me she was pregnant.,269
i'd slow down for girls like that,3
why do the women and kids get to walk on all fours?,35
‘mother with fawn.’ it’s an interstate highway system original.,-1
"yes dear, that does look like fawn when she was a baby.",-1
"now, the dramatic rendering of this madonna and child is quite evocative.",141
"this is art? even my kid could do this—if she hadn't been hit by a car, that is.",-1
and here we have madonna with child.,141
"the fawn can stay for now because she was born here, but we're worried about the mother. she's canadian.",196
"mother and child, classic nude.",-1
i took that one at yellowstone last summer.,53
it's always single moms.,-1
the artist has exhaustively explored the madonna-child paradigm.,141
'didn't jane tell you she would be posing nude?',-1
this is an old one of me and grandma back on highway 41.,14
your grandma and i were the first models.,-1
"a single mother coping with the stark realities of a post-industrial world, that's what i see.",-1
"see bob, you were not the only child raised by a single mother. get over it.",-1
her abstract alarmist stuff is a bit too realist for me.,168
"buck, here is one of you and mom.",-1
i wouldn't have let my daughter pose for that.,-1
"i know her, and she is not what i call wildlife.",-1
kinda sexist to always show the mom with the fawn,-1
she started posing for nudes when i fell behind on child support.,-1
the mother with child theme is so passé.,-1
this was the last image she posed for before the accident.,-1
"it's called ""madonna and child.""",141
she finally got out of the rut.,-1
"ah, the doe-na lisa.",319
"she seems almost caught between worlds -- half looking back to the yellow warmth and safety of mom, and half looking forward the great unknown beyond known boundaries. genius.",-1
"quit fawning, you know she's not real.",-1
she looks a lot like my ex.,-1
i told her that's not my good side.,40
"hmmmm. a silhouette of mother and child in a limited black and yellow palette. art, or road sign?",-1
notice how her eye follows you wherever you stand.,-1
i still prefer her early work with ducks,-1
"the ""madonna and fawn"" has always been my favorite!",141
doh! it's a deer. a female deer. my bad.,-1
"""all deer are equal, but some are more--"" hey wait a second, is that janice!?",166
at least they're not wearing bells and holly and pulling a sleigh.,55
"all the warning signs were there, but i got involved with her anyway.",-1
"her ""madonna and child"" series is a nod to neo-naturalism.",141
she never mentions being a model when we talk.,-1
"female artist, of course.",168
madonna and child is my favorite,141
there's no way she lost her baby weight that fast!,174
and that's how i met your mother.,-1
fat lot of good that did mom and sis.,-1
"everything is derivative, margaret.",-1
"she got custody, but i didn't expect her to flaunt it on social media.",-1
now here's a feminine perspective.,3
this is from her pre-feminist period.,-1
"and here we have the revered 'mother and child'. acrylic on aluminium plate, pre-1983 style. modern versions have a non-gender specific adult and child, so this is quite a treat, fred.",-1
it looks nothing like her.,-1
"while i agree with you that the mother/child relationship as artistic subject has become woefully trivialized, i find this particular rendering a moving example nonetheless.",-1
the artist discovered that patrons finally spent sufficient time appreciating her work when she switched the overhead lighting to high beams.,-1
she left me for the artist shortly after posing for this.,168
is this what women want?,-1
mom regrets that shoot.,295
her new work feels very cautionary.,-1
i prefer her blue period,95
she should never have posed nude.,-1
...and then she ran off with the artist.,-1
i'd give my right antler for her!,-1
"yes, that is my wife jane doe and my new fawn bambi.",308
let me guess: bambi and her mom?,308
mother and child...probably the most touching image in the entire dot series.,-1
"i named this one ""omage to mom"".",-1
i think parenthood suits her. . .the last time i saw her she was dancing on a pole and the bucks were all over her!,111
she's been unbearable ever since she posed for this.,-1
"i said i'd never let my wife pose for a nude, and here we are.",-1
oh dear. isn't that your sister,11
if she were walking a human baby we could get people to slow down and also say 'what the hell?',111
it certainly captures the pathos of the homeless mother and child living on the fringes of society.,-1
"i know it's been done before, but madonna and child is timeless.",141
it must be hard being a single mother with the whole world watching your every move,-1
"no, i think she's just standing closer to the artist.",168
"to me, they lack the urgency and emotional heft of her moose and tractor pieces.",-1
"you know fred, if we had this sign on stone road, bettie would still be with us.",31
she looks very much like my ex-wife.,0
i like this more recent work. she's really crossed over.,-1
"doe,a deer,a female deer.",-1
mother with child.,-1
extraordinary use of the female form. it invokes the circle of life theme in a pre-roadkill context.,-1
before she was a model i used to go out with her.,-1
"doe,a deer,a female deer.",-1
my mother pushed me into modelling at an early age.,-1
"this one is called ""madonna with blitzer.""",141
"it reminds me of my first wife,",0
this is the portrait of my wife and kid that was previously exhibited at mile marker 24.,-1
she'll be impossible after this.,-1
another single mother...,-1
"that's right buck, your grandma was a famous model , she studied fashion and ""de sign""!",-1
"it's feminine archetype signology rather than her usual patriarchy-oriented,herd-mentality,survival-of-the-fittest abstraction.",-1
"i completely agree, louie: she is a dilf.",-1
several on my mother's side posed for remington.,-1
the proceeds go to a memorial fund for the artist's mother.,-1
it's so nice to see our ancestors preserved in amber.,286
we saw this last summer at the venison biennale.,-1
to me this screams gender limiting in the role of child rearing...she is fine though.,-1
here's the one! my cousin's wife and fawn were the models for this one - she died shortly after this. sad story but they made it into a movie so the kid got rich.,87
it's always madonna and child! what about us stags?,141
this one resulted in the end of her visionary deer in the headlights period.,-1
i like this one with the mother and child with their gaze frozen in the headlights.,-1
these must be from the her 'yellow' period.,95
lovely madonna and child.,141
she's gained a lot of weight since this was done.,174
"she looks so confident, doesn't she?",88
i think she’s really captured that deer-in-the-headlights look.,-1
omg! she never told me i had a child!,-1
the mother got run over but the kid made it to a trophy room in bozeman.,4
her 'bambi years' are a bit too daunting for my taste,308
"this one was inspired by my ex right before she left with the kid. i call it, ""dear double crossing.""",0
i think that's my ex-wife!,0
and then they asked your mother to pose as the model for the sign.. her whole life changed and she never came back home again.,-1
"this one is titled ""mother and child xing""",141
it's a good thing she looked before she leaped,-1
"the amber background evokes the imminent danger bambi's mother faces, and thus the artist reminds us of life's tenuous and fleeting nature.",308
"yes, that's my wife, but that's not my kid.",0
"i prefer the dot's non-reflective ""madonna and child"" myself.",141
her recent red octogon series just wasn't moving.,-1
another madonna and child? how unoriginal.,141
"look dasher, isn't that your wife and kid? it looks like they're the stars of this exhibition.",-1
i was the first buck she ever made.,-1
"it means we're no longer needed, she'll take it from here.",-1
"this one's dedicated to my wife. i call it 'dear double crossing,....'",0
"no, no, no...i'm not looking at her, i'm looking at the kid.",-1
i'm sick and tired of the single-mother trope.,-1
she's got your legs!,-1
"wow, her legs go all the way up the her shoulders! a true super model.",-1
"you can tell, she's just in it for the bucks.",-1
she was cute but always played hard to hit.,-1
"yeah, we met in the 60s and had a great time together. but the kid, she could have been from any one of us.",-1
hmm - madonna & child theme suffused by an inchoate sense of foreboding...,141
"say, doesn't that look like jane doe and her kid before that terrible accident they had?",-1
that's you and your mother before you learned to jump.,-1
her earlier work was so pedestrian,-1
i love what it says about the mother-child paradigm.,-1
"after a while, if you’ve seen one “madonna and child” you’ve seen them all.",141
thats the wife and kid.,-1
i remember her. that kid could be mine.,-1
i have a sense of caution when i view her paintings.,168
i really like this madonna and child.,141
"fawn has grown up so much, hasn't she ?",-1
"she was a good model , but she got run over anyway.",-1
have you noticed that they always depict our women without a tail?,-1
who's the model for the new crossing artwork? she's hot!,-1
'madonna of the crossroad' by that early modern master. we're pretty sure humans gathered around these to pray to us.,141
"i see what the artist is striving for, but my mother would never let me lead when crossing the street.",-1
i heard she just got divorced,7
"it's called ""save the women and children""",3
bambi looks so much happier now that she has found a new home.,308
"a great artist, but a greater deeritarian, she saved millions of lives.",-1
her lines reveal the best of reindeer breeding. makes you slow down and look.,-1
"funny, i see an old woman in a scarf.",-1
"yes, an excellent example of post-minimalist madonna and child.",141
it's a rather mediocre mother and child in headlights rendition.,-1
for me it's a stark and cautionary expression of the mother-child dynamic.,-1
she was warned about her frisky behavior.,-1
i'm convinced she'd still be with us if the sign had only had a buck on it.,114
she looks fat in this one.,85
if humans crossed at signs like these we wouldn't have run over that grandma on christmas eve.,14
"that's bambi, i'm sure of it. i'd recognize her anywhere.",308
"sadly, this is the only known drawing of me and mom.",-1
but does the world really need another madonna and child?,141
this one speaks to me. possibly because the doe looks a lot like my mother did.,135
that's me and mother - she died on route 80,-1
she's had work done.,-1
bambi’s mom. breaks your heart.,308
looks just like her mother.,135
i think i knew her.,-1
"for, a deer, a female deer........",-1
i think mother-child art is an over used cliche.,-1
that looks like my wife and daughter.,0
"i, for one, am encouraged by the inclusion of the female graze.",-1
bambi's mother? i fucked her.,308
that's a nice likeness of mom and bambi.,308
i miss mom.,-1
did i ever tell you that my ex-wife was a model?,-1
they really captured her silhouette,-1
i am transfixed by her enigmatic smile.,348
she would have been a great mother.,-1
look at the fine details in this iconic image of the madonna and child!,141
not another madonna and child ...,141
that was my wife and daughter before a texting driver took them away.,-1
"""mother and child""....sooooo overdone.",-1
"ah, yes, the madonna and child.",141
"no, that's definitely martha.",24
she reminds me of my mother.,340
do you think she has implants,334
ah. the definitive madonna and child!,141
i think she's captured that 'person in the headlights' look.,-1
your wife has great legs.,0
i’m having a proust moment seeing my mother and me quadrupedal and all.,-1
this is the last thing my mother saw before she was run over.,-1
'madonna and fawn' by the master of interstate 80.,141
i miss her too bambi,308
she's a dilf,-1
not long after that she was shot.,266
the commentary on relationship between mother and child is superb.,-1
"i love the texture, the posture, the lady-stepping. finally, a doe who refuses to prance.",-1
the madonna and child. very powerful.,141
"during the rut she said, ""nice rack. big, strong.,"" so i thought... and then buck came along.",-1
"and in this scene, bambi's mother first realizes it's a forest fire, not a sunset.",308
"it would've been a nude, but her fawn showed up.",-1
that was me as a youngster. she taught me everything about where to cross.,-1
"my first, but she's gone now; a victim of the 'bump stock.' it's legal, you know.",-1
"i'm not sure we need another ""madonna and child"" in this day and age.",141
i told my ex and that daughter of ours that i would make them famous one day.,-1
she looks familiar.,-1
mom looks so young in that pocture,135
i can't believe it...i dated her in high school!,-1
jane was horrified when she learned humans are using this for street art.,168
she's got her mother's legs.,107
"ever since she modeled for this one, there's no talking to her.",-1
i didn't even know she was married.,-1
how on earth did a photograph of me and my mom end up here?,135
she was my muse.,-1
she's a feminist.,-1
it looks amazingly like my wife and kid.,0
reminds me how your deer mother fawned over you.,-1
"you know, she only did it for the money.",-1
i didn't know nancy had married!,209
"i am not ""fawning"" over her",-1
she reached the pinnacle of her talent in painting the state route 17 series. it's also the place where she got run over.,-1
she got cusdody,-1
i'd give her a 10 if it weren't for the kid.,-1
when i was a young buck i thought she was the most free-spirited wild thing in the forest--i trumpeted and rutted like crazy to get her to look at me. those were the days!,-1
she was one of rudolph's favorite models.,44
you didn't tell me about her!,-1
is that a picture of my mom and baby me?,135
that's mom and me in the days before cell phones.,73
"bambi’s mother was pretty, but she was no moose-a lisa.",308
this is a commission the artist did of a madonna and child.,141
single mother? still a turn-on.,-1
i like her attitude. confident! she's not hurrying across the road for anyone.,88
"yes, i know it's art but it's still reckless to depict her coaxing the fawn across the headlight zone...",-1
it’s amazing how fast this one got her figure back.,-1
"yeah, but you should have seen her before she fawned.",-1
"nice, but she does come with baggage!",-1
she looked better in stag films.,-1
i heard this was one of the last paintings that bambi’s mother posed for.,308
i commissioned it -- it's my wife and little timmy.,0
"in my opinion, this is kara walker's best work.",-1
this was the point where her work broke thematically from the herd.,-1
i knew her before she became a famous model.,-1
it just doesn't have the hart of her other work.,-1
i didn't know sarah had a fawn.,120
so i told her that the sign didn't make her butt look too big.,-1
that's a fine resemblance of martha and the little one.,24
i'm pretty sure i saw this one where your mother died.,-1
what do you think about this one for the south meadow? i love how the artist captures the strength in her antlers.,-1
you'd never know from her pictures that she had a lot of doe.,203
"if they had only paid attention, she would be with us today.",-1
and here's your great aunt bertha from your mothers' side of the family... may she rest in peace... and your cousin buck,70
ihat's the wife and kid just before they tried to cross the la expressway.,-1
i resent the artist’s privileging the female’s role in the childrearing relationship.,168
"it highlights the subtle essence of that song, ""doe a dear, a female dear.""",-1
that's my elizabeth and audrey.,163
is every artist required to do a madonna and child painting?,141
i was in a rut- then i met your mom.,-1
she looks exactly like my first wife.,0
"all in all, she was a good president. too bad she couldn't pass nationwide unlimited roaming bill.",5
"that's you with your mom . . . the last picture of her, taken just before she was hit by a truck.",135
her work lacks subtlety.,269
a very modern take on the madonna with child,141
i preferred her in her fauvism period.,-1
"""doe, a deer, a female deer..."" those lyrics are just a sign of our times.",-1
this is one of her earlier works -- note the lack of motion and detail.,-1
"of course, women and children get center stage!",3
your mother was murdered with the big bang bang.,-1
is it politically incorrect to find her attractive?,-1
'madonna and child:' exquisite!,141
"a late human era madonna and child apparently, gloria.",141
middle deere( i have never really enjoyed family portraits.) far right deere(that's why you will never get a woman mike.),-1
this piece truly captures the essence of mother-fawn bonding.,-1
"i see despair and longing, it's very moving. a single mother and her fawn. the dewy morning meadow. 18 wheels.",-1
"ah, yes! a unique piece. ""the challenges of the unwed mother""",-1
"you know, i was in italy last week and i'm just tired of looking at mother and bambino pictures.",135
at a party i'd ask 'em if they were sisters. works every time.,11
"i keep getting older, but she stays the same age.",-1
it's a still life from childhood... that's mom on the right.,135
"ever since this modeling gig, she won't give me the time of day.",-1
"that's shirley and little zack and the other two are me in full flight mode.. some rack, huh?",-1
"you're right, she does look fat",85
madonna and child. a classic combination.,141
your dear mother always fawned over you.,-1
i remember her - the urine scent was fantastic.,-1
i think she found herself in this work.,-1
"the painting shows a contrast of light and dark colors. the artist creates an emotional mood and space, having the mother follow her doe protectively. there are no real lines in the painting because it is painted in a pointilist style.",-1
the artist seems to capture the essence of her subject every time.,168
when she ran away with the artist she took the kid.,-1
i remember when your mom took you in here.,-1
can you believe what she's wearing?!,8
she said she was on the pill.,53
"she use to complain about every time she met a buck, they seemed to be in a rut. seems like she realized that wasn't such a bad thing.",-1
i really enjoy her primitive period,71
looks a little bit like my aunt edna,70
"when she won custody, that hurt badly enough. now she's gotta throw it in my face?",-1
she wasn't cautious enough.,-1
the irony is i had to shoot her with a strobe.,266
she's the one who double crossed me.,-1
trust the women to wangle the biggest wall.,272
hey bob isn't that you wife dora and your kid? i never knew she was a deer crossing sign centerfold.,-1
look how adorable i was before mom bought the farm.,-1
no buck—i knew she'd drag gender into it!,-1
we divorced after my wife ran off with the artist.,-1
i'm sorry but it looks nothing like aunt martha.,70
the glare of the yellow hides her true beauty......,95
this old bambi-mother trope somehow works.,308
"without sentimentality, the doe's fierce will to survive and protect her fawn is made real and palpable by the artist's unhindered and obvious use of colors.",-1
i just feel like she's lost touch with her audience.,-1
there is a family resemblance on your mother's side.,135
the the mother-daughter dynamic in this one really makes me emotional.,-1
here it is - 'madonna and child'.,141
i think that's marsha and her fawn.,-1
her prancing days are over.,-1
i ruminate about your mother and what might have been.,16
my aunt sadie and cousin buck never liked dodges.,87
"my girlfriend was invited, but i decided to come stag.",-1
"i tell you, she bares a striking resemblance to bambi.",308
"in profile, her butt becomes kardashian.",83
unbelievable! like she's ever crossed a highway.,-1
"my cousin bambi with my aunt. the artist really captured the pre-angst, even though they're in profile. residuals are still stuck in probate...",308
interesting abstract mother and child portrait.,-1
i'm just not attracted to a doe after she's given birth.,-1
it’s a good likeness of millicent and her daughter but black doesn’t do her justice.,-1
she always put junior first.,-1
not the best likeness of your wife and kid.,0
she really captures what it's like to be us.,-1
did you know that she was pregnant?,111
poor thing. she did not know it was a doe permit hunting season.,352
"as a madonna and child, it's utterly derivative work.",141
"alas, she ran off with a horny goat.",-1
"the organic symmetry expressed in the most daring flat tones so magically captures the purity of love between the ""fawning"" mother and "" deer"" baby.",-1
nothing is more beautiful than the female body!,3
she always had a nice figure.,-1
"derivative. paradoxically, her earlier works seem more mature to me.",-1
she makes me horny!,313
"she takes you right up to the guardrail and leaves you there, asking yourself, “what are those blinding lights?”",-1
she's definitely got your deer-in-the-headlights look.,-1
this one is just of my wife and little sally. i saw headlights and baled out.,-1
"damn, she was so hot back then.",-1
i always said martha would become a famous model.,24
that is so sexist. not all female deers choose to have babies...the humans are getting gender neutral restrooms.,-1
that's it: one more madonna and child or resurrection motif and i'm ramming it to smithereens!,141
"it's called ""madonna and child.""",141
i fawned over her for years.,-1
"not a sentimental approach, and her later works are less representational.",-1
her talent is so bright you cannot help but stare.,-1
poignant...lacks urgency...her butt's too big.,-1
"another remington masterpiece. an oil on steel titled ""madonna with fawn.",141
she never told me i had a daughter,-1
obviously pandering to the crossing moms.,-1
"ah, the timeless inner struggle of the doe. she longs to keep the fawn close, yet senses that first bud of independence.",-1
"personally, i've always been attracted to the female form.",3
"look dear ... a doe, a deer, a female deer ...",-1
mom and i posed for this picture.,-1
"she was the doe of every buck's dream, believe me.",-1
i wonder what happened to her after we migrated.,-1
she's had work done.,-1
that was me with my mother before i became famous.,-1
it's probably my favorite madoenna and her deer child.,-1
your mother was quite the model in her day.,-1
reminds me of madame monet et bebe.,39
"geez, not another one titled 'madonna and child'!",141
she got the record settlement -- and custody.,-1
this is what grandma had to go through?,14
she was my squeeze.,-1
"as can see here, once you give birth, you'll no longer be able to jump due to your weight gain and you'll most likely get the ""mom"" antler trim.",-1
"gloria steinem . . . ah, her doe-illism era.",-1
motherhood really changed her perspective,-1
i tried to get the wife and kids to pose for this but she was busy that day.,-1
"oh dear, her latest work is crossing into kitsch.",-1
leap of faith,76
"now janice and her kid got pained too, how? i've been wandering by the road forever.",166
"honestly, i like the madonna and child better",141
"that's jennifer, my first. junior's boarding at groton.",337
"yes, she played 'hard to get'.",-1
i was raised by a single mom... strongest woman in the world.,195
hunting season call her twit brains instead of dear.,352
we had to hold still for hours while she painted us.,168
"that is perhaps the most cautious attempt an a ""mother and child"" painting i've ever seen.",-1
that *totally* looks like her.,-1
i met her at a stag party.,-1
"you've seen one ""mother and child"", you've seen them all...",-1
i would say this doesn't look good for bambi's mom.,308
everyone thinks they're the next kara walker.,-1
i could swear they used my wife and daughter for that one.,0
as if the ladies didn't already drive ...,-1
it's a traveling exhibition from the hudson river highway school.,57
my wife's pressuring me to have kids. it just doesn't feel right in this economy.,127
"yup, that's her. i told her she could be a model. i really like her but i think that wise little fawn has figured out my motives.",-1
her hopping days are history.,-1
she’s no kara walker.,-1
very margaret calvert.,77
she was so much hotter before she had the baby.,111
frequently after these events their mothers end up raising them.,-1
she got everything in the divorce.,-1
"it's just called madonna and child, circa 1980",141
"yeah, right after rudolph she left me for another doe.",44
"to me, it just looks like faith and her fawn from down the road apiece.",-1
i can't stop staring at her headlights.,-1
this one is my favorite. it’s called ‘look out for madonna and child.’,141
you named her doe and not bambi?,308
really too bad she and the kid both got shot before they could collect any residuals.,266
"and on loan from the hermitage we have one of my all-time faves: ""the madonna and fawn"" by the late great leonardo deer vinci.",141
"""the wife and kid got tired of all the ""selfies"".",-1
that was your mother and younger sister before the accident.,11
"when i was your age, the moms stayed home with the kids.",-1
"madonna and child, even ironacally, is such a cliche.",141
i'm not really into madonna and child art.,141
"composition is good, yes. but i find her work rather cisgender-centric; plenty of antlers leaping over things, but not any tending to the children.",269
"doesn't look much like karen, but i'd recognize that fawn of hers anywhere!",6
when your mom left she told me she was deer-resistant. always with the jokes!,-1
"you'd never know it, but that's my daughter in-law and grandkid.",-1
"hey kim , could you remove just the orange stain!!",299
nothing says renaissance better than the madonna and child sign.,141
"so you're telling me she cut out gluten? -yes, marv, and you can see she looks great, but fawni has adhd, so you can't buck em all.""",143
never saw her in my life.,-1
she's aging like a fine wine.,66
i ended up with larger antlers but mom always liked you best.,30
i find that these representations of fawn-rearing as the highest embodiment of the feminine take me out of my rut.,-1
i still think ler was a strange name for my aunt.,70
and here i thought she just gained weight.,174
"ironically, bambi's mom never saw it coming.",308
she did jillian michaels.,-1
"she appears to be a shadow of her former self. as a stag, i can relate.",88
much easier than choosing the lady or the tiger,3
"she's known for her still lifes but her still alives are pretty good, too.",-1
"""just think,our youngest finally off on her own"".",-1
that cindy sherman really is quite something.,88
remember when you and your mother posed for this? we should have asked for more.,-1
the women are always painted so disproportionately.,-1
she reminds me of my wife.,0
it's reminiscent of her earlier neo-bambi period.,308
"myself, i like the madonna type.",141
"'for lifetime achievement: great artist, great mom and total party animal'",-1
i'm concerned with the iconic representation of the mother-child relationship within the high expressed emotion level of the family dynamic...,-1
...forever the same road sign: exercise caution for mom and bambi...but assume we are deadly projectiles.,308
"dough, a deer, a female deer.",-1
she was the first jane doe to sue for gender equality.,-1
mother and i posed for this one.,-1
she never knew what what her.,269
does she still cut on herself; and masturbate excessively?,-1
my grandfawn could create better art with her crayons!,168
madonna of the crossing,141
these are very kara walker-like.,-1
my mother was such a dear.,-1
the artist failed to capture mom's enigmatic smile.,-1
"you know, it's just not as finely observed as the madonna and child i saw last month in paris.",141
and this one was when i had to take the wife and kid along last rutting season.,-1
i think i dated her.,-1
she looks good for her age.,-1
that's the best picture of mom ever taken.,135
she really knew how to save a buck.,-1
"i really do miss my mom, she was such a dear.",-1
mona and her daughter lisa. it's perfect.,142
i’d go for her if she weren’t encumbered with the kid.,-1
she was fawning adoration but what she really wanted was the bucks.,-1
this is my favorite madonna and child.,141
she's still mad at me.,-1
i think renoir should have stuck to women with parasols.,-1
it combines the social concerns of barbara kruger with the aesthetic of `bambi.',308
do you think it makes her look fat?,85
great picture of mom!,-1
"doe a deer, a female deer. me, a long long way from accepting such this new design style.",-1
she got cusdody,-1
"maybe i'm just in a rut, but she looks like she could use a couple of bucks.",98
"so, who has been fooling around with my wife?",0
"okay, but look at those eyes! those are mom's eyes.",135
the artist told her she was another mona lisa.,142
i didn’t realize she was expecting.,-1
"she's a little tied down, if you ask me!",-1
"as you get older, mothers with babies are more interesting.",-1
"i knew bambi, before the foot got her.",308
ah. the memory. i whispered in her ear and clasped her with my hoofs.,-1
"so she says to me 'do you know the way to san jpse?' and i say to her, 'no, but i can tell you gilroy is just off the 101'.",-1
she said she was on birth control. just what i need is fawn support,53
"she hasn’t lost the weight, poor deer.",174
live right and maybe some day you’ll grace the walls of this road kill hall of fame,-1
i dig that mother and child angle,-1
"it always surprises me how horny the mother of my children still gets me. is it like that for you? eh, maybe i'm just a dear.",-1
she should have used birth control.,53
"the title is ""women's work"" but i do try to help!",3
"martha: ""oh dear ... they are so graceful ... but they have no antlers. the bears will maul them to pieces and have a feast."" fred: ""law of the forest, martha. plain and simple. law of the forest.""",-1
mom always loved you best!,-1
she was my first love.,-1
she is in africa.,71
'madonna doe and fawn' by deercio. hmm. i'll wager it's a fake.,141
"hey buck, look at this. it is the actual 'deer crossing' sign that caused a woman from fargo, nd to have 3 separate accidents with deers crossing.",-1
our race has taken a big step in woman’s rights,3
"y'know, reggie, you can put as much makeup as you want on a western roe deer, but she'll never pass herself off as a nice, wholesome american red brocket!",-1
there's ol' bambi. just before she got roadkill.,308
a lone mother? this is so gender normative! i guess they call human art primitivist for a reason.,-1
at least her tail doesn't cover her...,-1
"the artist really captured the emotion between mother and child in this one called, ""bambi's mother.",308
where is her tail?,-1
not their best work. but they captured some of your mom's charm.,-1
see.... women always get the right of way. buckin rediculous !,3
she's got me thinking outside the bucks.,-1
she calls this technique 'ready-eer made',-1
i'm just commenting on how that doe has managed to keep her figure.,-1
"""i knew her...she was obviously a 'post-natal depressionist' - or at least she gave me that 'impression' at the time !",224
i will go back and tell her to hurry up if she continues to read every blurb.,-1
she thicc,270
really? no-one can doe a good representation of a mother and her child?,-1
"well, there is a certain continuity and repetition to her work. but, up close, i can see that this is probably an important transitional point.",-1
i'm not gonna be the one to tell her she hasn't lost the baby fat yet!,-1
and for the lady?,-1
i regret that we had to seat your wife at a separate table.,-1
and for the lady?,-1
"no, i'm afraid i didn't see your wife leave either.",0
is my wife still sitting at this table?,214
is this your first visit to the ulysses room at the james joyce restaurant?,268
and for the lady... what will you be having this evening madame?,39
and for madam?,-1
your wife left half an hour ago,0
and for madam?,-1
my wife will be joining me shortly. could you bring another menu ?,300
would you like to share or should i bring a second menu for the lady?,300
is my ex-wife still looking this way?,0
i'm sorry your wife was knocked-out by the menu. will you be dining alone?,300
i think i'll just have what she is having.,-1
now you can better see why we had your wife sit over there.,-1
"yes, we are farm-to-table. but, it's always summer somewhere.",2
our new menu writer is a big joyce fan.,268
she left just as you got to the entrées.,161
"tell the chef i am gluten free , a vegan , no nuts, hold the beets , avoid stone fruits , no salt , no red wine , no capers , no truffles, no vinegar, no onions. avoid garlic and dressing on the side ,theatre at eight.",143
where did you hide my wife?,0
that's what she said.,-1
... so that the chef's mother can read it without her spectacles.,-1
"and mrs, what will you be having?",-1
the lady will have the same.,-1
another place setting for your wife? of course!,0
we serve all of julia's recipes.,220
that's what she said.,-1
my wife still hasn't decided yet.,-1
your wife called to tell us you had forgotten your reading glasses.,0
she'll never know you're here!,-1
"our menu comes in tall, grande or venti, depending on your reading glasses.",37
can you turn back to the hors d’oeuvres? the woman at table three needs another minute.,-1
i recommend that you go ask alice,23
"the menu and the check ""grande"", everything else ""tres petite"".",37
will your wife be joining you tonight ? she's behind the menu.,290
"will that be tap, sparkling, or bottled from the rio grande?",37
water for the table? i can bring you niagara falls or victoria!,-1
i must apologise for my little deception. she's run away.,-1
the grande is on special.,37
may i suggest “may i ask you to repeat what your wife just said about tonight’s specials.,0
when my wife gets here can we get slightly smaller menus?,300
i bet you wish now you’d taken that speed reading class your mother had recommended the summer before freshman year.,2
those are the specials. i'm her to tell you about the regular menu.,300
have you and the madame joined us before?,39
so that will be the texas steak special for both you and the lady?,9
it's an homasge to julia child.,220
"now that your mother-in-law can't see you, could i interest you in some gluten-free appetizers?",143
wait till you see how my wife eats.,9
we only serve grande cuisine.,-1
"the menu at the le grande had doubled in size every year. that said, it only opened last year so was arguably quite large to begin with.",37
"here at “alice in wonderland steakhouse,” we find it part of the whimsy to juxtapose our menus with 1 ounce pours.",23
welcome to ruth’s chris cheesecake factory.,183
we give every option on the menu and only 5 minutes for your girlfriend to decide. welcome to hell.,300
is this the grande carte...,37
"last time my wife and i had a fight about who makes the decisions, i brought her here.",-1
"in addition to what's on the menu, you can also eat your grandmother's pussy.",265
your wife said to order for her.,-1
"""bambi and mother; w. disney, circa 1942"" #sad.",308
"can you give me five minutes, my lady friend alice is very late! for this important date!",23
you think that's big? you should see our ultra-grande menu!,37
"i'm sorry, respect to the dignity of women is not on the menu this month.",300
wait till you get a load of the waitress’ cup-size.,152
the chef’s mother is dining with us tonight and her eyesight is poor,-1
would you like a few more minutes to call and ask your mother-in-law?,150
my wife likes the thousand island dressing.,8
see? they are taking all of our jobs. we need to make the stone age great again.,31
"just so you know, she's not known to respond very well to criticism.",-1
"yeah, she's good, but last year it was ballet lessons and before that, the violin.",-1
the wife insisted we get an interior designer.,180
wife’s idea. i just wanted nice blue walls.,180
"oh, great! now my wife’s gonna want to hire a decorator, too!",180
"last week it was this italian woman, enigmatic smile.",142
"i'm conflicted...my wife wants it out of the house, but the artwork is exquisite.",-1
i can't believe she left you for an artist.,168
"that's leezarde, my intern...she does all my drawings while i go out clubbing.",-1
i told her we're absolutely not hiring an interior decorator...then i caved.,180
we're lucky she came along. our other decorator just disappeared on us.,180
"if my wife asks, i drew them.",-1
"when i asked, she muttered something about the first illustrated cookbook.",197
"my wife calls it interior decorating, but i know smut when i see it.",180
"my wife just couldn't leave it at ""sit"" and ""stay"".",256
"...but i told her, ""no frilly flowers--it's a mancave!""",128
best summer intern we've had so far.,261
i love her contrast of prehistoric and postmodern forms,-1
doris insisted. i just wanted wallpaper.,68
she's keeping score.,-1
she's ahead of whose time?,-1
at least she didn't make you look chubby.,85
"when i kept a food diary, you said i was wasting my time. when she does it, it’s a work of art!",9
it's her grocery list.,121
"you know, mom's gonna blame us.",271
"she's far more than just a shapely tail, fred.",-1
"remember, she is very sensitive about her work, and it an hour past her lunch”",9
"her perspective could use some work, but she's got a real eye for color.",95
and my wife and i just stonewashed the walls.,-1
all she ever thinks about is food.,9
she was the only one who promised to have it done by thanksgiving.,-1
i can't believe she sees me as that fat.,-1
i prefer her pre-cambrian period.,-1
you know it. i know it. but does she know dinosaurs and humans never overlapped?,44
who's nina ?,-1
i know what you’re thinking but she’s done wonders with the place.,-1
she used to be big.,85
it's not really my taste but my wife loves this decorator.,180
my wife got tired of the old wallpaper.,-1
it was bad enough when she started walking on her hind legs.,-1
when you said liz was doing the wall decoration i though she was a woman.,163
my daughter can do that.,333
very primitive - she must have been raised by neanderthals.,44
can you believe that little reptile has been short-listed for the booker prize?!,-1
imagine the resale value when she's extinct!,44
i thought you told you wife no more interior decorators!,180
"i clearly said ""cavort."" but she heard ""cave art.""",118
"sorry, wrong cave. she's the artist in residence.",118
can you just go talk to her for me?,-1
she demanded complete creative control.,-1
my wife got tired of the old decorations.,180
"it's a risk, yes, but she's just as skillful as the males and i thought i'd give her a chance.",-1
i can't believe she left you for an artist.,168
"yeah, but my wife likes art more than a dinosaur steak.",-1
my wife hired a decorator,180
if i were you i wouldn't criticize her style.,-1
we better put our side of the story in stone too.,-1
martha hired some fancy foreigner to decorate.,24
we have no choice. she contradicts evolutionary theory.,-1
the wife insisted we get an interior designer.,180
her work is daringly post-cretaceous.,44
it's the interior decorator my wife hired.,180
think she's making a grocery list?,121
the brushwork is so exquisite i kind of feel bad about eating all of her eggs.,124
"they say you can live forever through your art, but her career is about to become extinct.",168
"she's an artist, she's single, you should be happy to club her.",-1
"yes... a great artistic touch plus an eye for fashion, intellect, charm and wit... but what really attracted me are her opposing thumbs...",-1
it's her late-creationism period.,-1
ladies first.,176
do you think she would do our portrait?,168
"let her finish, then we can take credit.",-1
"when i traded fire for her i thought we'd make little cave people together, but now all she wants to do is draw those pictures.",118
why is eleanor's picture on your wall?,-1
"she posts pictures of all her meals. time to attack, before we end up on that wall.",9
"for the last time, a petroglyph is carved into stone while a pictograph is painted on it.",19
she's on loan from the creation museum.,-1
it's really quite derivative of her earlier work,-1
anybody else getting tired of her pre-meteoric phase?,-1
all she ever thinks about is food.,9
it's ridiculous; every hunting season my wife gets the decorative wall painters in,180
"and you thought we had a wonderful stone age free of fake news, ha!",31
she's a bit too realist for my taste...,-1
"what did you expect from a pea-brain, the mona lisa?",142
"you tell daenerys."" "" no, you tell her.",38
"geez, she just got past stick figures. give her a little time for impressionism.",-1
"she said: ""wanna come up and see my etchings?""",-1
see? selfies. again. and she never gets them the way she likes the first time so she spends hours trying to get it right.,-1
the wife thought our cave needed some interior decorating and she was cheaper than the wallpaper lizard.,180
"so what's next, she sleeps between us?",250
did you tell your wife that you hired an interior decorator to paint the nursery?,180
my wife is gonna be pissed.,0
she's the new interior designer and says this is the latest rage in al fresco cave art.,-1
"our wives, kids & history will mock us if we bring down another artisticus rex. i say we keep after the orange tyranus who's been crapping all over the neighborhood.",44
wilma's gonna be pissed. she wanted water color.,93
"great! when our wives come home, we're going to get blamed for it.",0
"her short stories are terrific, but the novels have a lot of gratuitous violence and lack character development.",82
those are good but her watercolor primitives are the best.,-1
"when she's done, we'll kill her and sign our names.",-1
"yes, i'm also impressed by her refined technique, but i'm more concerned that ""cretaceous: dawn of a new age"" won't evolve past the themes she explored in her last piece.",-1
her work will be worth a fortune after she goes extinct.,-1
"while her representations are good, i've always found them a little too cold blooded.",336
"she's creative, but not much of a cook.",197
we can’t let her take the credit...,-1
tell me again how mom died?,-1

"yes officer dibble, my wife has read the restraining order.",-1
i think my wife found out about us.,0
"yeah, i'm pretty sure she wants a divorce.",7
i liked it better when she left notes on the refrigerator.,50
that's right. she delivered the divorce papers personally.,7
"sorry, no golf today. trudy just reminded me it's her birthday",162
she isn’t totally on-board with the divorce settlement.,7
"well, she signed the prenup. but she wasn’t happy.",114
it wasn't just the email. she also added an attachment.,42
"the good news is, she signed the papers.",-1
oh she's more than just talking behind my back.,119
now she's spreading vicious rumors behind my back.,-1
not sure what it says but she really seemed to take the “back-stabbing bitch” comment quite literally,50
she's delivered the divorce papers.,7
"yes,i'm a 100% sure she found the letter i wrote to you.",-1
at least she had the decency to leave a note.,50
"well, she decided not to sign the prenup.",114
she left instructions for my next wife.,0
she finally stuck me with divorce papers.,7
"i know, but this time i think she means it.",328

she overreacted ‘cause the job jar and fridge magnets were full.,-1
she served the papers herself.,7
she’s hired a real backstabber for a lawyer.,-1
and then i asked her to sign a prenup,114
"i think she means it, this time.",328
my backstabbing wife has just served divorce papers on me.,7
the wedding's off. she refused to sign the pre-nup.,114
"yeah, she served me the papers herself.",7
she said something about never listening.,-1
funny that you mention it. she did seem a bit upset.,-1
it’s safe to say she’s not bluffing this time.,-1
i just got her counter-proposal. what's our next move?,-1
"mother, of course she was decent enough to leave me a farewell note.",-1
"hello mabel, my wife found your letters.",-1
... and then she stuck me with a long list of demands.,-1
"well, she didn't embrace constructive criticism as much as i'd hoped",-1
"i think it's the divorce papers, and i'm guessing she signed them.",7
"yes, martha, i got the divorce papers.",7
i think i got her answer to the prenup.,114

"you were right, she served the papers herself.",-1
the good news is that she signed the separation agreement.,7
she just stuck me with divorce papers.,7

"yes, dear...your mother did leave a message.",-1
i'm pretty sure she wants a divorce.,7
the ex got just about everything... although she did leave me the title to the prius.,-1
she's fairly adamant about the divorce settlement.,7
"well, bravo, janice. this time you've also robbed me of my favorite metaphor to describe how this divorce feels.",166
apparently she and i have different understandings of ‘amicable.’,-1
"i can't read the fine print, but i think she's serious this time.",-1
"she says she wants out, and this time i think she's serious.",-1
"hi mother, my divorce papers just arrived.",-1
"yes, it's over, she served the papers herself.",-1
"yeah, she signed it, but she wasn't happy.",114

i think my wife found our love letters.,-1
"first you threaten to shove your divorce papers up my ass, then you stab me in the back with your demands, and now you want me to leave my response after the beep. it hurts, eleanor; it really hurts.",7
the good news is she signed the divorce agreement.,7
she served me herself. is that legal?,7
"no, i think i can state with some certainty she won't be signing any prenuptial agreement.",114
i made the mistake of asking for her ultimatum in writing.,-1
i'm beginning to think she was serious about the divorce.,-1
sure it hurts. but it’s just her opinion.,-1
my wife personally served me with divorce papers.,7
"yes, i think its fair to characterize her lawyer as difficult.",-1
"could you pick up some more post-its, margaret?",77

"i think the irs is serious this time lauren.""",247
"no, not separation. she's calling it ""reformation.""",218

i think i'm going to agree to counseling. she's made it pointedly clear that we have much to discuss.,84
"yes, she just finished the chapter on the protestant reformation.",218
your mother stopped by.,-1

she really stuck it to me this time.,40
her remarks were rather pointed.,-1
my wife finally signed the divorce papers!,7
i need to talk to my attorney. my wife personally served the divorce papers.,7
she really stabbed me in the back with these divorce papers.,7
"for starters, can a party to a divorce serve the petition herself?",7
let's just say that her divorce lawyer really stabbed me in the back.,7
i showed her the prenup. she said she’d think about it.,114
"i get the point, helen.",46
"you were right, mother. i shouldn't have shown her the will.",-1
"actually, my wife just delivered her divorce filing papers in person.",7
"no, this time i think she really means it.",328
and then her lawyer has the nerve to demand her knife back!,-1
"no, i haven't seen her. but she did leave a ""honey do"" list.",-1
no. no note she said i was clueless and left.,50
i can’t talk now. my wife and i are having a discussion.,0

"yes amanda, i have been approached by your legal team.",7
"yes, she was here. she served the papers herself.",7
"my lawyer has my back, unfortunately my ex wife does too.",-1
i think it's from her lawyer,-1
it seems that i should have gone with my gut and emailed her a pdf of the divorce papers.,7
i'll concede that she made a very effective point with her article.,-1
so i asked her to give me one example.,40
she took backstabbing to another level,-1
"yes, she did leave a note.",50
i’ve got this nagging feeling that my wife’s asking for a divorce,7
i asked her to take a stab at reading it.,-1
"yes, she left a note.",50

"you can tell my wife's lawyer i've decided to settle""",7
"actually, what hurts most is she could have told me to my face.",-1
i'm telling you my wife left me and stuck me with all the bills!,0
i just have a feeling that she means it this time.,328
hello 911; i think my wife just left me.,309
"she's not home right now, but she left a detailed note.",50
she strongly rejected the offer.,-1
"as a matter of fact, she gave me 95 reasons she's leaving.",-1

911? my wife's just nailed me with her grievances.,309
"can i call you back, mother? we're just reviewing the prenuptial agreement.",73
i'll call you back. my wife just gave me an ultimatum.,0

"hang on, i think she just finished the grocery list.",121
she found a sticking point in the divorce settlement.,7
"yes, the papers were served—but i must say “blunt” is the wrong adjective to describe their delivery.",7
"divorce papers just came through, she's not happy !!",7
"if she left a good-bye note, i haven't seen it.",50
"i think she's maybe considering leaving me, possibly.",-1
"no, it isn't just a feeling. i'm sure she wants a divorce.",7
she has a few suggestions about my will.,-1
my wife just left me a note. i think we'll have to pass on the card game tonight.,-1
and that's all she wrote.,-1
"it's not that she served me with divorce papers, it's how she did it that hurts the most.",7
she delivered the divorce paperwork herself.,7
my wife would like to make a few 'tweaks' to our divorce agreement.,7

"ok, martha, you can have the still life.",24
"actually, it's more like 106 theses; and, no, she didn't nail them to the front door.",-1

she said it was important.,-1
i just can't face the divorce papers she served me with!,7
i have a strong feeling that she wants a divorce.,7
i guess she really isn't happy,-1

"i'm sorry, she's not here right now. can't say when she'll be back.",113
"i'm sorry, mom, i have to hang up now. dora seems angry about something, and i should probably find out what it is.",87
as my lawyer you said she might reject the divorce papers but she went way too far!,7
"divorce papers, can you believe it? i wish there was a phrase for what she's done to me.",7
"yes, i showed her the divorce settlement offer and i think she wants to talk.",7
sigh... yeah... she left a note.,50
she is reliable to a fault. whenever she leaves she leave a note.,50
"well, she did explain herself.",-1
"i'd love to, but my wife has a couple of things around the house she'd like me to take care of.",0
"then she screamed, i can not live another minute with your passive aggressive dullness!, then the phone rang and as i was walking over to pick it up she pinned the divorce papers to my spine with a steak knife... and how 'bout you, how're you doing?",7

"yes, my wife left me the divorce papers a short time ago.",7
"i have no idea, officer...all i told her was that she knew where she could stick her ""to do"" list",-1
i can't keep ignoring her cries for attention.,-1
"she called it, ""pin the divorce on the donkey""",7
"just a hunch, but you could try reaching her at her mother's.",-1
she seemed surprised that i asked her to take a stab at drafting the pre-nuptials.,321
ironically my ex-wife was the one doing the screaming.,0
"first, she shoves it in my face and says her lawyer drew it up. then, she tells me i'm numb in every conceivable way! now, she's gone and i can't find the damned thing!!!",40
and i want you to tie the response to a brick and throw it through her window.,-1
but i thought that 14 year old girl wanted me to write a love note in her yearbook.,-1
"can't talk now, mom, darlene just gave me a shopping list.",-1
"yeah, so... she brought over the papers this morning..",7
"tonight's no good, the wife's really getting adamant about my to-do list.",243

she said no more indulgences.,-1
"janice, the cable company just delivered a late payment notice.",-1
hello 911 ? my wife has upped the ante on her honey-do list.,-1

i think she's leaving me.,-1
"margaret, i hope after the divorce is final, we can still be friends.",77
"hi mom, shelia is divorcing me. no, it won't be friendly but i can't really see her point of view.",16
let me call you back. doris just served the divorce papers.,7
my wife reminded me of a few more things to consider before the agreement can be signed in blood.,7
"she's been saying ""it's over"" for years. i think she means it this time.",328

"well, to take a stab in the dark, i guess she used a knife.",50
my wife claims it's because she ran out of refrigerator magnets.,-1
she signed the divorce papers.,7
i get the impression she won’t sign the nondisclosure agreement.,114
i thought her attorney was only going to be a pain in the ass!,-1
...my emergency is that when i said it would hurt less to have a knife in my back she didn’t understand the irony,50

"i haven't read it yet, but i think she agreed to the divorce.",82
i can't find the advice my wife and i got from the last marriage counseling session.,84

"ok so i'm not leonardo, but you're no mona lisa",142
"i want ""raging bull"" -- not ""little women""!",26

of course it doesn't work as well in the summer when the super turns off the heat.,2
your rendition of ave maria has a lot of clanging and hissing.,-1
will you be playing the steam punk rendition of amazing grace?,-1
yes it deffinently accentuates the warm tones ... but come summer i think you will be playing a completely different tune.,2
"all a misunderstanding, i called morgan plumbing and said “i think we need to replace the pipes morgan.”",-1

it's a steam organ. fire her up and let's see what she can do.,-1
"ok, it was cheap, but we can't use it in the summer.",2
open 'er up and see what she'll do.,342
i liked the sound when my wife hit it with a hammer,0
mother superior requests you pull out all the stops. apparently the sisters are are getting somewhat overheated.,11
why does the organ sound better in winter than summer?,2
does this mean we can't use the organ during summer services?,2

she's a little rusty.,-1
we bought this from princess leia organa furnace-stova.,13
"it might not look like a queen, but it plays great water music.",1
does this mean your mother is going to live with us forever now?,-1
"great, but what do we do with it in the summer?",2
what if we changed the processional song from amazing grace to steam heat?,74
do you want me to open her up?,342
"can you play ""steam heat"" by the pointer sisters?",-1
so that’s why ave maria sounded weird this morning.,-1
but does it work in the summer?,2
this won't sound as heavenly during the summer.,2
"it was great for the winter, but what are we going to do now that summer is approaching?",2
so when you play we get music and heat. i guess this means you’ll be taking summer off again this year,2
i know you like the pointer sisters and i like their pop hit “steam heat” too. but this is too much!,-1

i assume there will be more a cappella repertoire this summer.,-1
"i said ""amazing grate"" not 'amazing grace'.",74
"your hissing and pinging are serviceable, mrs. cravits, but the explosive bangs are startling the choir.",-1
i think amazing grace would be a good hymn to warm them up.,74
i was inspired by my wife's hot yoga class!,210

i'm not as confident as you that this will help stoke the fires of faith.,76

can you turn up the heat on that ave maria?,-1
sister rebecca will no longer be the only one that radiates warmth.,-1
your version of amazing grace is very hot.,74
the only problem is summer concerts...,2

i am surprised that my sister lets you decorate like this,180
my daughter thought all my children should be represented here.,333
"well, it’s a good thing your daughter got over her love for giraffes.",276
it was either her or my reality.,-1

"the pigeon is roasted with a side of potatoes anna, garlic spinach and a caution not to move your chairs without supervision.",326

"madam et monsieur, the chef created for your delight acrophobia followed by general anxiety.",39
your hot girlfriend has arrived.,-1
if monsieur and madame are displeased with the menu then may i suggest we move your table a little closer to the edge of the ledge.,39
not exactly the breakfast at tiffany’s i expected.,-1
floyd & karen thought “edgy” for her birthday dining experience,6

"madam and monsieur, welcome to la rebord.  todays'  special is, pigeon.",326
"oui, madame. the pigeon is very fresh.",326
"your table with a view, monsieur and madame.",39
perhaps madame et monsieur would care for the moroccan-malaccan souffle. it's cutting edge.,39
maybe one day she’ll realize i’m the one that got away.,119
'she says she needs room to breathe...what does that even mean?',357
she's sleeping with the fishes. just not this one.,15
"so then i tell her, ‘well after two days your mother stinks too.’",350
...and then she gave me this koi smile.,-1
"i'm not making this up, she wants us to get a cat.",22
"...and before i knew it,i'd fallen for her - hook,line,and sinker.",229
"and then, would you believe it, she tells me, ‘there’s plenty of fish in the sea!’",15
"she's freshwater, i'm saltwater. it just wasn't gonna work.",-1
i can’t believe she left me for that shrimp.,15

"so, the waitress says ‘do you want anchovies on that?’ ...and i just looked at her.",-1
"so i told her, ""yeah? well you eat like a pig.""",-1
"then she said,"" you're not the only fish in the sea.""",15
so apparently asking if she'd like to sleep with the fishes isn't the stellar pick up line i'd imagined.,15
so i told her it was me or her cat.,22
she had this way of making me feel like i was the only fish in the sea.,15
"flush yourself, i told her.",-1
yeah? well you pour like a girl.,281
"and just like that, she flushed me down the toilet.",-1
she said she didn't need me. then she took my bicycle.,-1

"grow some legs she said. yeah, that will just take about 400 million years.",71
"she left me for a goldfish. everyone wants a goldfish. just you wait, in a ​few weeks that relationship will be down the drain.",15
"food pellets, koi pond, and 500,000 kids...she got it all in the divorce.",-1
and then she took my bicycle and left.,-1
but all she cares about is what school i went to.,-1
last time i date a witch.,21
she fed me a line and here i am.,229
"as soon as i saw her, i was hooked.",-1
i can’t believe she was using me for bait.,-1

can you give me more than just 'the suspect seemed really full of herself'?,-1

well it happened 25 years ago so i'm not sure what size she would be now.,85
"well, you said that the suspect was full of herself.",-1
"it's useless, barbara, they won't open up.",234
it was her or one of her sisters.,-1

"no, i can’t pick her out of the line up, they all look the same to me.",-1
look i know it’s a weird painting but i promised my wife i’d hang it up,-1

of course that's her. i can pick her out of a crowd..,-1
"it' s like mother's, mother's, mother's, mother's, mother's, mother always said.",-1
i still think she's hiding something.,86
my wife's personal trainer kept telling her to work on her core.  i think we must have misunderstood.,-1
can we line up the wonder woman set instead?,-1
"despite the uncanny similarities, this shouldn't take long.  the witness said the suspect lacked dots on her cheeks.  that's number four, counting from left to right.",-1
"the odds are stacked against her, but let's avoid russian to judgment.",136
"i couldn't get her to talk at first, but then she really opened up.",342
"she looked like that, but she seemed taller.",85
i think number four had plastic surgery to conceal her identity.,86
"looks like the 'like mother, like daughter' saying goes on for all generations...",-1
the witness claims she only saw one woman.,-1
intelligence we received suggested that she’d been smuggling women into a woman nestled within another woman’s women.,-1
i could only get my sisters.,11
"yes, she does appear to have some form of split personality disorder.",-1
watch out for the little one. she's the strong and solid type.,-1
i was told to round up 'the usual suspects' for this russian witch hunt.,349

"after she was diagnosed with multiple personality disorder she kept telling me i was destroying her ""little nest"".",-1
the witness claims she saw them all together.,-1
it’s not sexist carol. the literally are dolls.,136
i have a feeling that #4's blush isn't the only thing that she's hiding.,86
number two is my mom.,-1
her alibi just doesn't stack up.,-1
it's only one woman!,3
"this job supports me, my wife, and our five daughters",127
"if you press the short one hard enough, she'll open up.",342
the oldest wants her own shelf,-1

i know... it's supposed to be a witch hunt. but i keep finding these.,349
"we know a voice insider her made her do it, but the question is <i>which</i>.",-1
i had no idea she had a split personality.,88
i got it--'no' meant 'no'--so i asked if she had any sisters.,11
what can i say?  she was russian and a real doll!,136
"the teller swears she only saw one of these suspects. the other five must have been hiding some
where.",-1
i suspect there is another insid-her,-1
"okay, come clean. we know you're smuggling women in those containers.",-1
only the first five are my wives. the last one's my daughter.,127
we had to put the baby up for adoption. she just didn't fit in',111
number six looks like she's hiding something.,86
victim says number 4 looks familiar.  can you ask her to turn to the left?,86
"i got her to open up, but she was full of herself.""",342
i think she's full of herself.,88
i'm not sure 'getting her to open up' was really helpful.,342
"she’s the one, alright.",-1
"chief, why are the women in my life always so full of themselves?",3
i did not have sex with these women.,-1
"believe me, i know their m.o.
my mother was a matryoshka!",-1
"ok, so the small one did it... but how are we going to get her to open up?",342
i distinctly remember she had a removable face.,-1
". . . take your daughters to work day, why?",-1
you can drop the internal smuggling charge but she's paying for 6 economy seats.,49
i swear.  i only knew the mother .,-1
...but i feel like a woman on the inside.,-1
"i feel like there's a small russian woman inside me, trying to get out",136
i just know she’s in there somewhere.,-1
i'm quite in touch with the feminine inside.,3
obviously the one without blush on her cheeks.,86
why you theenk russian deed it? could have been american girl doll?,136
"actually, i need seven wives.",127
this is a witch hunt.  no collusion! i've never met these women.,349
"my sister, my mother, my sister, my mother...",107
"you know i can't stick my neck out for you on this one, karen.",6
"yeah sure, they can paint me up as a woman but i’m not wearing a skirt.",-1
"i thought this would be a tough case to crack, looks like she opened up.",-1
"so i sez, ‘yo, doll,’ and she knocks me over. again and again. ‘til i saw double.",40
the tall one is my wife,85
just because she's stacked doesn't mean she shouldn't be able to nest in public.,228
definitely the girl in the middle.,-1
"i'd like you to meet my family. my wife,nikita,and 5 daughters- galina,raisa,natasha,kalista,& suggested by a friend,ivanka.",-1
before i identify her i'd like to hear them speak.,-1
i just feel so hollow without my little girls.,-1
"yes dear,  the girls do seem to take after my side of the family.",11
i think one of them is my mom.,107
it's a portrait  of  my wife.,-1
"personally i think we can let the little one go, she can't harbor a fugitive.",-1
"deep down inside,i know she's guilty.",-1
we've got her on five counts of occlusion,86
our witness said she has a scratch across her left brow; it turns out they each have a scratch across their left brow.,325
i think the little one will talk if we can get her to open up.,342
"this gang is slick, but the weak link is always dimpleless; carry her in for interrogation.",-1
i got my girls just where i want them.,3
"honestly, i only touched her scarf and base.",-1
"now that she's gone, i know it's not possible to replace her.  she was one of a kind.",113
"she may look like a doll, but she's as nesty as they come.",-1
"rossetti, watch out for that tiny one on the end. her street name roughly translates to ‘souless babushka of death who also makes great blinis’",-1
they're still questioning the smallest. she won't crack.,-1
i'm almost certain at least five of these women were involved in an inside job.,-1
"she was russian, wooden in demeanor, but just can’t remember her height.",136
"thanks, but actually they look a lot more like my wife...believe me, she’s a doll!",-1
polygamous?! my wives are lying!,127
"wendy, i am going to need your help with this serial mother.",-1
"the victim couldn't give much of a description, but said she was a real doll...",136
"she gave me her babushka dolls, so i let her go through.",-1
"inside me, there's a series of women, dying to get out.",-1
there was an inside woman. and an inside-inside woman.,-1
"to catch her, you first need to get inside her.",-1
"none of these, but i can tell you that whoever did this is an empty vessel of a woman.",-1
"if say it was the little one, but i'm afraid there's something even smaller and more evil that made her commit the election fraud.",5
"this is hard for
me; she was a completely different woman on the inside.",-1
"her alibi just doesn't fit""",-1
so i called in my daughters.  what of it?,73
"these are my daughters.  they are ll,9,7,5,3,and 1 years old.",-1
we’re looking for a woman who can take her place alongside prior greats who have helped us develop our famous product line.,-1
it is no. 2. she cannot understand russian.,208

i can't do it anymore.  i look in their eyes and just see my mother.,135
"i’m telling you, she was there and then she was gone… can",113
can you see if #6 is hiding another one inside her?,86
it was a closed case until she opened up.,342
"she has been in a cell for three days, of course she is pale.",-1
"well, this explains the ""getaway mom.""",-1
"hey, all the witness said was she was medium build, between 3'5 and 5'6, and we really need a conviction here.",136
"linda, i finally made our lineups more scalable. aren't you proud?",54

"when i said 'she looked like a doll,' i really meant more like a ""babe.""",136
"it's damn hard to say who could flip.  but that little one, she's really been keeping her apron clean.",-1
how many of you do i need to open to talk to you about which is your real wife?,0
"a nice woman, yes, but she really needed a shrink.",-1
"she did identify the mugger, but she mumbled.",110
number 1 was literally beside herself when i brought her in.,-1
i didn't know she was pregnant,111
the witness identified all of them -- was it because the perpetrator was running away from her?,109
why do i want off this case? because the only suspect is my mother.,-1
how would i know she was russian?,136
i can't hide it any longer - there's a woman inside me longing to come out.,-1
well you see the football team was in a huddle and i thought they were talking about me so i decided to hide in the woman's room,-1
"i'm sorry, it was dark inside. but she did have a distinctive mole.",-1
witch hunt?,349
the witness is nesting. hopefully she can identify at least one of them!,109
"time and time again, her modus operandi has been remarkably similar.",-1
i feel like there is more than one me that was hurt by her.,-1
"and when i arrived home, she'd put all my belongings in a box in a box in a box in a box on the stoop.",-1
"when you’re investigating the russian mob, lydia, getting a good height estimate from witnesses is critical!",136
"it's a witch hunt, alright.",349
this is all a misunderstanding.  i swear i didn't mean nuthin' by it when i asked if i could try to fit inside her.,-1
it wasn't my intention to diminish women!,3
they do look like their mother. but fortunately none of them has her secretive personality.,135
my mother said it was hereditary.,-1
she was wearing a bubushka that's all i remember,8
i can't stand it. she won't talk to me.,-1
"'it's a family tradition. when i was still inside my mother motryashka, she sung to me a story her mother sung when she was still inside of her. it's a story of how to make money in russia.'",-1
you finally got the mom to crack,317
"all i said was, 'whoever one did it, she's a doll!'",136
the victim identified the perp by her hollow eyes.,-1
"you wouldn't think she had it in her to commit a crime, would you?",-1
"'the one with the babushka' doesn't really help us, lady.""",-1
"i'm sure its the fourth one from the left, as she's hated me since i removed her cheek spots.",86
this one's a tribute to my mother.,340
of course she complains about wearing hand-me-downs.,-1
i can't help feeling like we're stacking the evidence against her.,-1
i just felt like she was hiding something,86
these russian ladies have agreed not to tamper with the november elections in the u.s..,136
"...comrade, i believe my adopted family, whilst they despised her, were entirely legless at the time of the alleged crime - so it can't be them who physically adducted my missing mamuschka",136

"can you and your six identical daughters help find whoever glued my hands to my waist, and your hands to your thighs?",-1

and is eve your ex-wife?,71
was there a woman and an apple involved?,122
i can only say that your wife eve told a different story.,0
i'm going to prescribe some xanax for your friend. that should help her unwind.,53

would you say she's your main squeeze?,-1
"so, for 'emergency contact' - your wife or your main squeeze?",309
when did she develop this crush on you?,-1

"by any chance, do you have a wife named eve?",71

"yes, i wrote the emotional support animal letter for the peacock lady.",10
she’s never gotten so attached to a patient!,284
"ok. so, first date, and you thought she said ""pie-a-thon""...",-1

my wife wears a boa...,249
"well, i think you should have listened to your wife, eve.",0

"my advice? lighten up and let your wife eat the apple. if the problem persists after that, you may have to move, no matter how nice your garden is.",122
you are preaching to the choir. i have a wife and four kids.,127
it's a straight forward case of separation anxiety. she doesn't want you sitting under the apple tree with any one else but her.,-1
and you say that your wife asked you to get her boa from her closet?,249
is this your wife’s boa?,249
i’m sorry mrs miller but our insurance company considers this a preexisting condition,115
you  say she's an old squeeze who just can't let go?,-1
i’ll describe her as an emotional support boa.,-1
it started when she offered you an apple,122
"no, i'm quite certain it's er-reptile dysfunction, although you should still be embarrassed telling your wife.",0

has your wife noticed?,0
she's fine. she's not supposed to have feathers.,249
"given the strength of her attachment, i'd urge you to rethink your view of this as some sort of illness.",-1
i think she may have been asking for a feathered boa.,249
you say she just asked you to hold it for a minute,-1
so the drag queen auditioms didn’t specify a feather boa?,249
"so, you wanted to get your wife a boa?",249
when nurse gomez told you to take off your clothes ... she also meant your spirit animal.,10
how soon after you refused a bite of ms. eve's apple did this happen?,122
"so, when you agreed to this, you thought your wife meant a feather boa?",249
we determined she loves you & won't squeeze you to death so you have nothing to worry about.,-1
i'm referring you to a witch doctor.,21
"jewish mother?  me, too. 'never leave home without a wrap.'",-1
have your wife keep feeding it twice a day.,-1

"well, she obviously likes warm-bodied creatures.",-1
"rest assured, we've left no stone left unturned in determining your diagnosis.  your labs, ct scan, mri, treadmill, lung function tests were all normal, so i'm referring you to psychiatry to help you with your sensation of being strangulated.",84

it must be something going around—my wife has also been feeling suffocated.,-1
i see here your wife is allergic to snakes,-1
"your new diet plan seems to be working, at least until she gets hungry.",-1
she only asked me to pet it.,10

"madame speaker, be assured that my opponent will soon reveal another side.",39
"welcome to the climate change conference. 
the first to speak is mother earth.",36
there she goes with the overheated rhetoric again.,-1
and now it's my pleasure to introduce everybody's mother!,-1
my opponent naively perceives herself as an expert on global climate change.,36
how does my opponent know she's not just having another hot flash?,226
whoa!... who do you think you are? my mother?...,107
and making her final appearance ...,-1
lock her up!,-1
she's had her 4.5 billion years.,-1
my opponent has the gall to assert that her health is more important than corporate profits,226
why is nobody asking 'girthy earthy' over here about her  controversial 'pangaea years'?,36
and now i let her tell you more about the gravity of the situation.,40
my opponent is not healthy enough to survive her term in office.,226
"now madam earth, isn't it true you're just perimenopausal and temperatures are expected to return to normal in some years?",36
here to speak tonight is mother earth... and she is a little disappointed in you.,36

mother earth waits for her turn to speak at an anti-climate change conference,36
"why madam, you are nothing but a climate change alarmist!",36
"ma’am, your personal problems are of no concern to the american people",60
our next speaker has the audacity to think she can change the world.,-1
i contend that the advanced age of my opponent renders her unfit for world leadership.,226
and our next speaker is mother earth who comes to tell us about  having too many hot flashes.,36
"look at my opponent, alice, who is carrying the world on her shoulders. alice? alice?",23
"and now let's hear from my opponent, mother earth.",36

my opponent thinks she knows so much about global warming!,36
"and now, live on our stage here at the epa, and speaking for herself, a very angry world",36
"offering her rebuttal in the climate change debate, we welcome to the stage... mother earth!",36
"my opponent may well believe that she's warming, but has she considered whether it might just be psychosomatic?",226
"and now, mother earth on her story on ""how i survived in spite  of your abuse.",-1
"i’m sorry, madam, but you’ve had your turn and you’re out of time.",-1
"despite my mother's naivete, it is money that makes the world go 'round.",-1
"my opponent, mother earth, is a bully, just like all climate alarmists!",36
i challenge my opponent to produce her long-form hawaiian birth certificate!,-1
"yeah, atlas, just walk away and leave her to the rest of us ...",335
"who are you going to believe? me, or her?",-1
my oponent thinks she knows something about climate change.,36
my opponent would have you believe she  feels the pain of global warming more then i do?,36
"mother earth, may i call you 'mom'? you've heard all sides of the climate change debate. we'd like to hear from you. speak up, mom.",36
"see ladies and gents!

"not now, mother. i'm trying to sell these fine folks a border wall.",-1
"mother earth, do you believe climate change is a hoax?",36
my opponent makes unsubstantiated claims of global warming. we all know she is just having hot flashes!,36
"there you go again mother earth. i may be sleazy, but that's not where i was coming from when i said you were hot.",-1
"i know you're passionate, mom, but you have to sit in the audience!",-1
and in closing i ask: do mothers always know best?,-1
"and to prove the earth is flat, i brought the impostor herself.",36
"my opponent may lead you to believe that she's big and mighty, but when you go to the polls, you must remember: it's a small world, after all.",-1
my opponent will try and tell you she isn't flat and that she has a fever.,226
"excuse me mother, but my opinion on global warming is just as important as yours",36
my opponent only tells the truth when it's convenient for her.,226
"and now it is my honor and pleasure to introduce one who needs no introduction, mother earth!",36
her argument that climate change is real is totally biased.,36
"can i finish?!? thank you... what the world fails to recognize, is her responsibility in all of this.",-1
mother earth is joining us today to discuss her plans for our future.,36
"just answer the question mother earth, when will you release your taxes?",-1
"...and now, mother earth is here to lecture us on climate change.",36
i think the world of my opponent but clearly she is confusing her menopausal hot flashes with a global warming.,36
"and i told my wife, melania, that it's mine, all mine.",0
just because you’re my mother!,107
my mother is always blowing things out of proportion.,157
and my opponent here...lyin hot mother earth,36
"'mother, i promise you'll have the last word'",-1
"look, lady, i have just as much experience and knowledge about climate change.",36
"she can say all she wants about rising temperatures and seas, but i made a snowball in april, so what does that tell you?",-1
introductions are unnecessary.  her stage presence is global.,-1
i think we should let australia speak for herself!,226
see? she's full of hot air!,157
"and, if my worthy opponent were really in tune with what's going on, she'd realize the public is tired of hearing about climate change.",36
"you see, you see, she is just blowing co2 at you!",157
"okay folks, let's give it up for our next speaker--mother earth!",36
will you stop ignoring me. now listen to your mother earth!,36

"regardless of how much evidence she's presented, i'll just never believe that climate change is real.",36
"hi mom, i finally made it to the world stage.",-1
"with all due respect, methinks the lady doth protest too much.",351
my opponent needs to accept that our momentum is irreversible and her time is done.,226
her ego is out of control.,88
"w o a h , stop  stop ! .. madame speaker , are you ok ?",39
"...in conclusion, while my opponent flatly denies it, all her arguments are nothing but hot air.",226
"nevertheless, she persists!

margaret olnek, superior, colorado",77
"you all know her as the late, the great, the soon-to-be-retired ...",-1
when they said mother earth was going to speak today i definitely didn’t expect this.,36
you have been nothing but a drama queen.,-1
"what's that, mother, you say all the other countries are behind you?",-1
my opponent would hope to distract you with her earthy comments.,226

„see? if there was a problem she would speak now!“,-1
"folks, please welcome gaia here - she is in town just to soak up a little atmosphere...",-1
she’s turning her stance yet again!,-1

..so i'm sitting on the wall with the queen..,1
"she called me fragile, jim.  she said emotionally, but i know she was talking about my shell.",-1

when they said “great fall” i honestly thought they meant autumn.,32
"my summer was great, but then i had an awful fall.",2
"after the spring and summer we've had so far, we can only hope to have a great fall",2
my mother abandoned me again,-1

my wife caught me with this free range chick and beat the 'devil outta me' !,0

"yeah, she humpty-dumped me.",257
"right from the start, i knew she wanted to change me... but i’ve just realized it was into an omelet.",-1
all i said was “everybody deserves basic human rights” to my aunt karen,6
"and i says to her, i says, if those are organic then i’m jumbo",69
my wife beats me and my cholesterol's high.,0
"and then she said , ""do i look fat in this shell?""",-1
"so we're sitting on the wall, and she says, tell me about yourself.  so i say, ""well, i am ovoid, 19, and,""  then she screams, decks me,  and i  end up in pieces on the ground.",-1
she misunderstood when i asked her to spoon me.,-1
this summer has been rough. i could really use a great fall.,2
"...and now i’m broke, but at least she’s got her omelette.",-1
"i knew i was in for a great fall, but no one said anything about summer.",2
the queen’s women patched me right up.,1
i just knew one of these days she was gonna crack.,-1
"so-so summer, great fall...",2
so all the queen's women put me together again.,1
this summer has me beat... i hope we have a great fall.,2
i never should have told her she was my beneficiary,-1
and then a woman named karen said ...,6
"summer has been awful so far, but i'm hoping for a great fall.",2
"'apparently, she's looking for more than just a three minute egg.'",124
it's been a rough summer but i'm looking forward to a great fall.,2

"you know, i really liked her but her jokes kept cracking me up...",-1
can you believe she said i was soft boiled!?,-1
something strong!  my girl friend just dumped me and i'm all broken up.,257

she told me i was cracked in the head. i couldn't argue.,-1
"and then she said something about an omelette, and i got outta there.",-1
"if it were up to me, i'd rather have a lousy summer than a great fall.",2
"every time she leaves the nest, i get smashed",228
"usually, when someone breaks up with me, she just breaks my heart.",-1
"you know, my mother always told me not to sit on that wall. i should have listened.",272

i had what she had!,-1
"...and they said to me, ' you're outta luck, this is queen's county, we ain't puttin nuttin back together again'",1
all i did was compliment her on her eggliness.,124
"hey barkeep. guess i shouldn't told that chick in the corner booth, she reminded me of my mother.",130

"none of my friends could put me together after she dumped me...ah, just give me that brandy with ale",257
"so then she says, ""ya know, you're not all you're cracked up to be.""",-1
she called me a crackhead and kicked me out.,40
she said she wouldn’t and couldn’t put me back together again,-1
all i said was that at her age she should be happy for any egg she could get,124
i fell for the wrong girl.,-1
my wife’s going to fucking kill me.,0
all i said to her was my mother’s egg salad is tastier,34

"if we ditched the modern art and painted a life-size mural of the african plains on the wall, maybe she'd feel more at home.",168
yes she’s cute but i was happier when you and i were doing the necking around here.,33
"(whispers) “margaret...there’s human’s behind me again, isn’t there?”",77
"well karen, this might just be the most normal thing we’ve seen all year.",6
at least she’s social distancing.,211
she wasn't kidding when she said she takes in all kinds of rescue animals,-1
she pops up when rachel maddow is on tv.,305
she went to great lengths to get spotted.,-1
i thought 4f said she was getting a rhino.,-1
this way she can keep an eye on the kids for us.,111
well...now she can't move.,-1
"ok, i did tell her to stick her neck out.",33
she's always poking her head where it doesn't belong.,-1
it was a little easier when she was younger and didn't block the tv.,182
she's always sticking her neck in where it's not wanted,33
maybe if we give her our netflix password she'll go?,194
we share this duplex. she prefers the lower floor,56
her name is alice and she likes a nice kale salad,69
i guess she’s working from home too,-1
i’m still worried. the doctor said she’s in the 10 percentile of weight,-1
my aunt left it to me in her will. what was i supposed to do?,70
did she cut in front of us?,27
"judy, i think it may be time to pull the trigger on that coffee table.",110
at least she's quieter than the herd of elephants upstairs,240
stick your neck out they said.  and she’s the one who listened...,33
"sure we have to feed her, but our clean up is a lot easier than for the folks downstairs.",9
and when she grows up?,-1
i think she belongs to the zookeeper downstairs.”,-1
"when i said that i was okay with rescuing that giraffe i meant that she could live in the barn, not in the basement",276
not exactly what i had in mind when she asked to share our netflix...,194
"look on the bright side.  until they find her a home, the other end is in their apartment.",222
she gave us her hulu password.,194
at least she's not throwing loud parties every weekend like the last tenant.,-1
"we do have to feed her, but at least we live upstairs.",9
she's a lovely alternative to a coffee table.,110
"oh, that's mrs. romano from 2g, she grew up here.",71
"definitely a different genre, but i'm kind of warming up to her.",-1
she hasn’t even noticed our new abstract art.,168
how is she going to bend over?,-1
"when we adopted her 4 months ago from the shelter, they told us she was a tall dalmatian puppy! we love her but now she doesn’t fit in our apt! since you’re a veterinary therapist, what would you recommend?",10
let's put in a flight of stairs so she'll be able to get into bed with us.,45
"of course, it makes perfect sense now.  i thought you'd consulted your sister the interior designer, not the one who works for the new yorker.",180
"this should have warnings - 
she's gonna have nightmares about those hyenas...",-1
she doesn’t have disney+.,194
she should’ve bought the duplex,56
it's true i love her,-1
she always pops in during pledge week when they replay the bebop segment of ken burns's jazz thing.,-1
i think it's about time we address the elephant in the room. her name is giraffe.,240
i suppose this is what she meant by duplex.,56
"hey, she's not wearing a mask!",97
"that’s it, i’m not falling for these cake pranks anymore judy !",18
"okay, she was tiny when we got her.  now she's not.",85
my therapist said it's because i have trouble appreciating what's in front of me. she made it sound like i was missing the elephant in the room.,84
moma mia!,-1
maybe we should just get her a netflix subscription of her own.,194
...and her tongue matches our blue couch!,-1
"well, it is her service animal.",10
"the good thing is, we only have to feed her",9
she says she's had it up to here with apartment living.,56
and i thought she was self-quarantining in the basement!,41
it is sad she does not like our paintings.,168
she's paying to use the space. better than that  last roommate we had.,56
"judging by her expression, she likes whatever they're doing down there!",-1
the people downstairs asked us to stop giving her popcorn.,-1
"at first i was supportive, but when she told us she wanted to be called geoffrey from now on, i never thought it would end like this.",-1
maybe she should get her own wi-fi.,194
i'm glad we're only tasked with feeding her.,9
i knew she'd turn up. she never misses this show.,-1
you’re breathing down her neck again!,33
"i told you the giraffe window would be worth it, cheryl",276
she’s here for the artwork.,168
"seriously, linda? a giraffe in the room? we just got rid of the elephant.",276
"maybe if we put a hat on it, your mother won't notice.",204
she's chipping in $5 month toward netflix.,194
the glass ceiling better watch out for her,101
she’s not in our social bubble. where’s her mask?,97
they said the lady downstairs was a little extra.,-1
"when they moved in, she was just a little girl, see how she's sprouted  up!",-1
she broke through the cement ceiling.,101
"when the realtor said pets were allowed, i didn’t think she meant one that actually lives two floors down.",56
this is a long shot but has she swallowed my putter?,-1
"ok, we do have to feed her, but we definitely have the best views.",9
"i'm not blaming anyone, but you did insist on naming her.",-1
"you get her hooked on westworld,then expect her to stay cooped up downstairs during the finale?",-1
they thought she was a tea cup pig.”,-1
"- honey, thankfully she likes to watch the same shows we do ......",182
"sure, yeah, we have to feed her, but imagine what they're getting one floor down.",9
"you were right, she is vegan.",69
i thought her apartment wasn’t a duplex,56
"well, she is head and shoulders above all the other service animals i could find.",10
if i phrased it that she saw me ‘neck-id’ would you be a little less mad?,33
at least she took off her hat,204
"as pets go, she's really high maintenance.",10
"susan, do you ever wish i was taller?",85
"she watches a lot of nature programs up here, so i usually sit with her downstairs and watch something else.",-1
"i can understand that the choices we make can sometimes have an effect on our style of life, but renting downstairs was my own authentic way to pay mother earth back!",56
the agent did say she heard the apartment downstairs could be a real zoo sometimes ...,56
"i know it’s our turn to host movie night, but does she have to block my view?!",182
"yes, girexa is much better. but she only picks national geographic episodes that feature giraffes.",276
"honey, just like us she’s trying to practice social distancing in her tower.",211
notice that grace?....wait for it.,74
i was curious why she insisted she help decorate our apartment.,180
"are you going to finally admit that it would have been a bad idea to live on the ground floor?
rebecca hawkins 
paradise valley , az.",-1
at least she’s streaming the same shows we are.,182
i told you she’d keep popping if you introduced yourself.,-1
"i’m getting a little tired of your attitude denise, we’ve watch 12 hours of animal planet already.",-1
do you think she’d be down to split rent?,56
i can't wait until betty gets her own cable television.,92
"honey, i’m starting to like our upstairs neighbours more than the downstairs ones. she’s starting to stick her neck in where it doesn’t belong.",-1
that might be what our therapist meant when she said the 800 pound gorilla can come in many forms.,84
can you believe she's never seen an episode of the office?,105
she's also got mineral rights in the basement.,56
"it's better than her head banging on the floor at all hours, but now i can't see the tv.",182
"we should let her go in ahead of us.""",-1
do you think your therapist does this for all of her patients introducing  new partners?,84
"first she complains about the heels, then the music, then the cooking odors, and now she guilts us into this?!",-1
is she o. k. with takeout!,-1
they told the co-op board she was part of their extended family.,105
"i know she's lonely, but please stop inviting patricia over for movie night.",182
"my guess is, she likes our view",-1
"hey, bro, she's like blocking the tv.",182
"i know a lot of these tall, leggy blondes all look alike, but she's always stood out from the herd.",-1
"evelyn, now are you  happy that we paid more rent for the second floor?",56
"wow, you're right. she does see the animals on the tv.",-1
she's spotted something else!,-1
my sophie the giraffe is all grown up too.,276
"remember julie, it's your turn to clean the wine cellar",66
her name is alexa. i got her on amazon.,304
"i guess i can make heads of it, karen",6
"it’s fine, she’s just here to take a break from her kids",-1
i thought it was funny when she said ceiling’s high enough for the giraffe.,276
"the breeder said this was a 'teacup giraffe', didn't she?",276
she really needs a shrink.,-1
it’s your turn to feed her,9
she’s really sticking her neck out on this one,33
i can’t believe she still hasn’t finished the sopranos,-1
‘i thought you said your mom cleared the room’,-1
"i thought once she went to college it would just be you, me and the coffee table.",110
"our days to feed her are mondays, wednesdays, and fridays.",9
every time i see her now i get weak in the knees.,88
"no kidding, her name is roses.",-1
we really should have taught her to pee outside.,-1
mother always said new york is a big zoo.,-1
"yeah, but she's really not bothering anybody.",-1
well you’re the one who said she could stay up past her bedtime.,169
it’s sophie the giraffe but for adults,276
"was your mom made of glass, the tv is on.",-1
"i told you we'd misheard the realtor when she said ""room with a view""..",56
and this way she can watch tv with us.,182
cut her some slack; she’s carrying the weight of the world on her shoulders.,-1
i told that new tenant she should consider the duplex!,56
it had been a heady moment when she found an available high-rise.,-1
"beyoncé’s new video seems authentic enough to us, but what do you think?",186
"better than the ostrich upstairs - every time we see her,  she's in a panic.",-1
"well, sharon, she did give us her disney+ password...",194
she really loves oprah.,-1
"oh, did i mention your mother has been hinting she’d like to move in with us?",-1
get used to it -- she owns the air rights.,157
it was a lot of trouble and she’s not much of a conversationalist.,208
we could give her the spare room.,-1
she's been ignoring us for two hours. let's ask downstairs if she couldn't handle the guacamole.,-1
she's our eyes and ears on the ground,-1
"they said the experience was immersive, but...should we give her the remote?",182
"sit, karen.",6
she could only afford a basement apartment.,56
i was hoping to bubble with my sister’s family.,11
"i'm telling you, she's going to have trouble pulling her head back out.",-1
i know your mom loves her flanders and swann records but this is ridiculous!,-1
she likes the discovery channel.,-1
"aww, do you think she’s watching tv?",182
"the giraffe says, 'my wife is a slut.'",-1
it's the lady from downstairs. she likes to pop in now and then.,-1
"we enjoy sharing cable with you and mrs. stretch, but c'mon jeff, animal planet again?",-1
"calm down, dear. she always wanted to get ahead.",-1
karen putting her opinion where it doesn’t belong!,6
"when the neighbor asked to share our netflix account, i didn’t know this is what she meant.",194
your mom told me to check up on you,-1
she said _whatever_ pops into your mind..?,40
"since she and geoffrey at toys r us broke up, i’m letting her stay here until a spot opens up at the zoo.",-1
"of course, she’s adorable. and yes, i support a vegan lifestyle. but, the landlord could have said something before we signed the lease.",69
"when i said, “let’s do some necking,” i had something else in mind.

i still say your mother is spying on us.,-1
"us buying a cheap condo by the zoo,was your mother's idea, not mine!",-1
she really likes us.,119
can she change the channel?,182
"you okay, janice?",166
"if you pull your hands out from under your ass she talks.""",-1
"when we need her, our neighbor really sticks her neck out for us.",33
"sure, we have to feed her, but i still think we got the better end of the deal.",9
emotional support my butt!!! i want charlotte back!,-1
this part i've accepted. it's when she takes a lap that i struggle.,-1
makes it hard to watch tv. i can't see rachel!,305
"i get it, it's sort of fair, but she could wear a mask.",97
she thought she was breaking through the glass ceiling.,101
she pops up twice a week to watch the voice!,182
"next time, we're keeping the emergency fund, and my niece can do the modern art.",168
"'we should take out the carpet,' she says. 'hardwood looks nicer,' she says.",210
she really had to stick her neck out to allow this to happen.,33
"well, it is her neckflix account",33
"it can be disconcerting, but she helps with the rent.",56
"angela, i think its time to cancel the national geographic channel...",-1
she's the perfect penthouse pet.,10
"hello, did you see my baby? she must be starving in the lock down.",-1
... and she won't pay for our netflix for moral reasons...,194
"-sometimes the hot water in the shower goes completely cold or goes to the temperature of the sun -

is she ahead of us in the line?,-1
"when she asked to share netflix, i thought she meant our password.",194
i hate living above that bitch carol baskins.,-1
"she's not really functional as a coffee table, but she makes a good coat rack.",110
"mary, the ostrich that moved in above us,  said she might join us later as well.",116
ahead of her time?,-1
if she didn't poke her head through our ceiling no one would've guessed the place is upside down.,101
now she can watch nature without having to have one leg in each bedroom and her forelegs blocking our view.,182
you can't call her a stalker when you told her to pop her head in any time,-1
"i tried to put my dick in her mouth, but it was a no go.",-1
"doris, something just came up....",68
"she's got another thing coming, if she thinks she's going ahead of us.",-1
she always has to arrive five hours early to our parties.,-1
she's still covered by rent control.,56
and she tells me i’m a pain in the neck for hogging the remote!,-1
i’m sure she’ll feel at home now.,-1
i think it’s time to get daphne her own tv.,194
i’ll insist on using the stairs until she agrees to wear a mask,97
i read that carol baskin moved to nyc recently.,-1
yeah no- she seems a lot happier.,-1
"since we cannot travel to kenya this summer, we brought kenya home.",2
"well, she technically is six feet away from paolo and gertrude...",-1
"what am i supposed to do with half a giraffe, susan?",276
she thinks this is an appropriate response to me asking how’s the weather up there...,-1
"listen, it’s fine with me if you want to keep her, but i’m still going to need a carafe.",110
at least we get to feed her.,9
"fine, she can stay, but you’re cleaning the liter box",-1
i'm not sure she goes with the apartment's minimalist theme.,56
"i told you, she always gets skin rash by watching fox news",-1
it's modern art sarah.,168
not very likely at this point; i even had to take the hallway door off the hinges to get her in.  they're supposedly hypoallergenic.,-1
i think she pooed.,-1
do you think we should giraffe her a question?,276
i think she wants to neck.,33
at least we’re not in the apartment below her.,56
"a penthouse above the zoo, she said, all of our friends would be envious she said. geez!!",56
the neighbor downstairs asked if we would mind her having a pet....,10
i knew the rental discount for an apartment above the zoo would not be worth it. what if she's a spitter?,56
"not sure what's worse: the fact that this is the only way to make her comfortable, or that now we know the floor's two inches thick.",85
if we switch to voice control she won't be able to keep changing to the animal channel.,182
i told the zoo keeper downstairs that working at home wasn't a good choice for her!,-1
she’s always looking down on us and it’s straining our relationship.,-1
it's your turn to clean her box.,22
"another looky lou, joyce",268

...unless she drools...or sneezes.

(3) remind me to thank the seffarigs for sharing.",-1
but she’s a rescue gwynn. and i promise we can pick up your acacias from the bickerstaffs in 1a in the morning.,-1

she will even stick her neck out to protect us1,33
"ron, call your mother and tell her that i didn’t kill the acacia”",-1
we can’t complain. she really stuck her neck out for us.,33
in the end it was easier to just accommodate her.,154

i'm not sure this was what you mom meant when she told us to get a quarantine pet.,41

 a tall order!",-1
i mentioned the new loft condo development to linda and steve from downstairs.,56
"when we signed the lease, i didn't realize we'do have to feed her, too.",56

"great, she discovered the national geographic channel.",-1
"you've got some neck.""
""she doesn't understand my needs.""
""could you show me something in a grey tweed.",33

"coming soon is the “princess and the pea” sequel, “two princes in a pod”!",343
"this has been a fun swing, but i best get back to my wife.",-1
i never promised you a rose garden.,29
do you think she’ll let us play on the trampoline too?,-1
"so, how, with grace and dignity, do we get out?",74
"my queen, i say it’s fit for royalty if it fits royalty.",1
vaccine is on the way! next year we’ll be in st. lucia!,41
"if i can smell it, she can too.",350
our summer castle begs for this sort of ambience.,-1
"honestly, it's not what i expected when you said, ""the queen and i swing.""",-1
"if she wasn't carrying a broad-axe, i would remind her that i requested a ham hock",-1
"do you think you might be taking this ""queen of leisure"" thing a bit too far?",1
"she's thinking , ""i can't bare that i gave this up for a knight on the town!""",25
"what’s next, elizabeth?  ‘maybe a swing set for the kids?",1
you said covid wouldn’t change our autumn vacations...,-1
"my dear queen, you have toe jam.",1
"why yes, this was my mother's. why do you ask?",-1
"okay her eyes are closed again, let's play footsies.",35
summer's over and this is all have to show for it??,2
"true, the throne is harder but at least it needs no summer breeze!",2
my queen; the duke and duchess have accepted our invitation to swing.,1
"finally, 
summer vacation!",2
she got the thrones after her head didn't fall off,235
not exactly what i meant by “summer palace.”,-1
"i know, awkward, but she likes to watch.",-1
what do you mean you thought you were queen for the day?,1
i think the lady called us a banana split...,-1
the queen mother does so enjoy the hammacher schlemmer catalog. do you have any idea where she put the thrones?,-1
torture? try staring at your wife all day.,0
do you think your mom would let us eat cake?,-1
the queen will see us and kill us for relaxing,1
we're toast! even i'm wishin' i'd voted for hillary!,5
"and we couldn't get a queen, why?",1
the wife.,0
"such glamping, though it please my queen, leaves me sore bummed out.",1
i didn’t know it would be this much fun when i won “queen for a day”!,1
you think if i farted she'd smell it?,350
"until she turns ten, can we not have the princess decorate?",13
this new cotton throne lacks some of the wow factor of the iron throne. but summer is coming!,-1
i just hope that she remembered to cut the crust off.,-1
"she’s coming. remember, you didn’t get it from me.",113
"my queen, do you think the court would be unhappy if we cancelled this years masked ball?",1
it sounded cooler when princess brianna was talking about it ...,13
"it's called ""glamping"", my queen.  all the royals are doing it.",1
"gee pops, i mean ‘your royal highness’, this is cool and all that, but when my old lady, i mean ‘her royal highness’ suggested we hang out together more so you could teach me how to be respectful, do you really think this is what she had in mind?”",1
do you think this is what mother meant when she said share the throne?,-1
"now you've done it, mom's not letting us out until our countries make peace!",-1
helicopter moms are a thing of the past.,191
i should have overruled you and got a queen-size hammock.,-1
"mom, we’re ready for the real canoe now!",-1
and then she said “let’s do something more contemporary”.,-1
i think mom has gone way overboard with the twin thing.,-1
"you just had to send the throne out to be washed now, when the queen of england is coming for a visit.",1
yeah i have a queen too. she’s so hot. super hot. but um she’s not around cuz she’s queen of canada.,1
i thought for sure we'd love it after i used the one at the duke's summer palace.,-1
"my mom is still waiting to hear your decision on the guest room.""",-1
your mom has finished chopping the veggies.,-1
"isabella: ""columbus said this cost 20,000 maravedis.""
ferdinand: ""did the tainos laugh all the way to the bank?""",37
"look on the positive side martha, they only pillaged",24
we’re like two queens in a pod.,1
"so i says, ‘iron throne?’ what am i? banging my sister?’ hahahaha! ahh...no? hello? mom?",235
"what's that my queen?  the kingdom's finances?  honestly, not good.",1
maybe it would be better if we get your mother-in-law to tell us a story?,150
"queen for a day!
careful what you wish for!",1
"this officially takes the trading with columbus too far, isabella.",37
"i know, i know...you can take the girl out of crown heights but you can't take blah blah blah.'",-1
you think the princess would like this better than the mattresses?,343
« but mom said it was my turn today »,-1
"balls, said the queen. if i had 'em, i'd fire the renovator.",1
did you hire her?,105
"their respect? you've gotta be kidding, susan.",17
your mother and i think  it's about time you go out and pillage on your own.,-1
whenever we hang out she acts like she wants to cut off your head,-1
you know we have absolutely no privacy anymore.  i know she’s listening and probably writing a book!,86
did you see how big her dragons were?,38
mom got the royal bunk beds in the divorce,-1
"oh, my queen, this is so relaxing, and the world just goes away.....",1
i told them you are the queen.,1
so you really are a queen?,1
guaaaarrrdddsss!!!  the queen has run hammock!,-1
has the queen been getting on your nerves lately?,1
"this might be why mom kicked us out, nah never mind",96
"when i said, ""it's been a hard week, and the queen and i would like to just hang out together friday night,"" this wasn't what i had in mind!",1
"i’m telling you, a hammock built for two will appeals to you female base.",-1
"the therapist suggested i make a concrete demonstration of intimacy, my lady.",84
and then she said; if you tell anybody what we did on this hammock i’m gonna chop it off,-1
i mentioned we were swingers and she asked if she could stop by.,-1
"is this what the queen of england meant by swinging?""",1
i told you a queen-size wouldn’t be big enough!,346
"' go ahead, axe herself '
is but a figure of speech!",62
"phew, when mom said we were gonna swing for this, i thought...phew.""",185
i’m tied of feeling like this is a baby crib and we need her to safely get us out.,252
"two things you should know:  1. we're jewish,2. she's a mohel",-1
if we avoid eye contact with her we can relax here for two more hours,-1
nothing like getting away to our summer home...,2
i find her originalist interpretations a bit antiquated.,168
i looked her in her optical nerve and i said “biiiitttccchhh”.,-1
and then what happened? did the cult lady get confirmed?,-1
so this is what princess bananahammock has been raving about?,13
mum says she's going to circumcise us royally.,-1
your sister is taking the throne so it’s only fair that you take the hammock.,-1
"well my queen, you asked me to get rid of the court’s entertainment. so now, this is it for us, deal with it.",1
i think i’d rather swing with a queen,1
mom says she needs to axe us something...,-1
when the queen catches you slacking off,1
thank you for letting me join you princess consuela banana hammock,1
"her highness has a  new throne -
a  hammock to sit on?",-1
she really was maid to be our guard...,-1
sitting all day long on the throne all summer was giving me blisters.,2
"i think the last time i asked the maid to dust the furniture, she got a bit overzealous.",-1
she'd prefer we call it queen-sized.,346
"true, a summer hammock doesn't do justice to camelot. but, at least it's not the winter of our discontent.",2
do you think julie andrews could come and sing that song to us?,-1
"i know our subjects want women in seats of power, but this is more painful than sharing a bed with you.",3
"this arrangement isn't ideal, bien sur, but the peasants demanded the queen and then agreed that the mattress was a better offer.",1
"yes, the 'princess test' is supposed to be with a pea. but that's p-e-a!",343
"in the princess and the pea she had real mattresses. what happened here, dear?",343
"you know harry, maybe we shouldn't have separated from the royal family...""
""well meghan, it is really hard to do doggy style in a hammock...but i used a blacklight on the throne and let's just say, the queen has been getting busy with someone.",-1
so this is what the rocking that the queen was talking about,1
"you were not joking with the last name, princess consuela",-1
"if we swing too far, she moderates knifely",-1
"""wouldn't a queen size bed be more appropriate?""",346
"swingers at last my queen!""  allan katz, madison, connecticu",-1
"professor morgan, i have the lab results from the last week's clinical trials on your genetic experiment to create a super-smart... uh, professor?",-1
"i""m proud to be known as the first woman on your research team. but humility compels me to decline being honored also as the first woman to try your experimental formula.",3
"i'm sorry to tell you this ms. welton, but you're under qualified.",-1
your group of  ivy league  graduates weren't given the placebo.,202
"hi, i'm catherine, most folks just call me cat.",22
mrs. brumley's cat scan is tomorrow so you might want to take the day off.,22
"leslie, please stop reminding me i was made in one of your tubes.",-1
they never talk about of mice and women.,58
so i see our first test tube baby is a big girl now!,-1
behind every smart mouse is a even smarter woman,58
woman: i thought you were working at disneyland?,-1
"what, you've never seen a female scientist?",-1
"where are my kids, sandra?",-1
‘it’s about your mom’,16
"excuse me, no women allowed in here",3
yes ma’am. tested it myself.,60
"the formula worked, professor.  i now look and feel like a real woman.",3
"yes, i know it's unusual to see a woman in this field.",-1
day 3 of the experiment: anna the lab human is starting to believe she is a scientist.,-1
sheila felt uneasy now that the lab rat had been promoted to her boss,58
"lab rats matter, karen.",58
"well well well, if it isn't the rodent who's fucking my wife",58
"@mar_ly_rose “oh hey greg, hows the behavioral research diagnostic on the speed of sars-cov-2 among homo sapiens going?”, “well linda, it’s going great for the mice!”",58
"guess what, karen... you’re going to disneyland.",6
so you think they'll normalize women in science soon?,3
"good morning dr. murine, i'm ms. badger with hr and i'm here to discuss concerns raised by your coworkers about side effects that might be related to your animal studies.",53
"look, as a woman in science i also had to go through a maze to get here and all i'm saying is that as a straight white mouse you're still vastly overrepresented in the research.",58
"i started in this lab from below, young lady!",10
of mice and woman,58
she finds the vaccine or else she gets the maze again.,41
i'm sorry to say but your a mouse now but at least your appearance improved from how you used to look (women sighs jews are really ugly).,-1
"experience? well, doctor, my last job at the cosmetics lab was to test, ah, using, ah . . . i was a waitress.",-1
"no karen, you were not complimenting me when you called me a lab rat.",58
yes it is rare for someone like me to work in the lab. i’m just here for a photo shoot. marketing wants it to look like we have women scientists,-1
"so you're saying, you want to know how it would affect a thirty-something woman?",3
"chief, we've got a lead on that farmer's wife.",242
i spoke to hr and they said as long as you are okay with it i can dress up as cat-woman for halloween,-1
i’m docking you two cheese curds lisa! get back to work!!!,-1
yeah my mom can’t stop talking about her first-born moving out of the subway and getting a job in research,-1
"i suppose we can let her out of the cage, it is take your daughter to work day after all.",-1
"you know, i think my great aunt harriet would have loved you.",-1
we can agree that rats and women haven’t received the credit we deserve for medical breakthroughs.,58
"in mother russia, mice test on you.",58
"the term 'lab rat' is politically incorrect, karen",58
"susan, i prefer the title ""lab technician""; ""lab rat"" is just insulting.",58
and so then i realized that a mouse would lead a study before a woman would.,58
"the bubonic plague was a warm-up,susan. we’re in control now.",17
"are you sure you want the antidote, professor? even your wife tells me she prefers you like this.",84
"um, no i haven’t seen your wife",0
is there a mrs. lab rat?,58
"congratulations on the new job. i know it's hard for women to advance, but frankly, i never thought you would be promoted first.",-1
"you got some nerve showing up here, lady.”",-1
"wait a minute, those buttons, are you wearing a female lab coat",59
i'm ashamed to say that it's true.  but i didn't know she was your mother.,-1
"i know we were both up for the promotion but you have to let it go, teresa.",-1
"i see. so ""mousy little girl"" is actually a compliment.",-1
"your mom says hi,",360
your mother is the second tube from the left.,135
janice told me i have funny ears!,166
should we try this on my mother-in-law first?,150
ok doc are you ready to see mrs cats?,22
i am glad to see you rose above the maze and made something of yourself.,-1
"miss roberts, i can assure you my dna is not worthy of this mickey mouse experiment!",58
who would have thought a woman could become a scientist?,-1
"i think it’s time we come clean about the affair, lisa",-1
"actually, a lot of women work in stem now.",3
doctor about sending your wife to the lab for an interview. they misunderstood . where would you like the remains sent?,284
what's your best guess on how many babies these moms are likely to have?,-1
you would have a lot more satisfaction making up with your wife to make a baby together the old-fashioned way.,0
excuse me ms. dickson. may i check on your fallopian tubes?,-1
"your wife left a message, dr. little. she's going to late for dinner again, something about her personal trainer.",0
"so here's the elevator pitch: i'm grace, and you and i live in a maze. but what do we call it?",45
you make me feel like a natural woman.,3
the first round of results might make your wife get rid of  all the mirrors in your house for your own sanity.,-1
"we women have come a long way, but you rats haven’t done badly either.",58
"you're fired, young lady.  no mask, no job.",97
i'm in charge now lady!!,-1
are you related to mrs. frisby?,64
"really? you've never seen a female scientist before?""",-1
"we’ve banned animal testing, so our new subjects are middle-aged white guys who think they should decide what women can do with their own bodies.",3
"bad news: we’re still looking for an anecdote. good news: unlimited cheese” - rebecca riegelhaupt, london, u",179
"not to make a pun, but your results were amazingly swift...and may i complement you on your taste in ties",-1
i’ll finally be recognized for my many contributions to science. thanks to  the work of all women before me!,3
"funny, you were a human bitten by a rat, and i was a rat bitten by a woman.",58
hello dr. mousekewitz. karen from h r and i’m going to need you to come with me to answer a few questions that the nice ice agents have in my office.,6
are you sure my wife won’t notice?,0
"when it’s just the two of us, you can call me mom.",73
"my mother was thrilled to hear about you. ""a doctor, you say.""",-1
"alright, linda, i'll admit it.  i wasn't fond of those growth hormones at first but i'm proud of what i've accomplished. now, where's my treat?",-1
so then we put amelia back in her test tube,-1
"thank you, professor. 
if i missed her birthday, my friend would forever call me a lab rat.",58
after the injection your mom cut 23 seconds off her run through the maze.,-1
"i understand, i have a cousin who started to look like her poodle after a few years too...",10
gee golly! ever since i was a little girl it's been my dream to be in a clinical trial.,224
"if you assumed the anthropomorphic mouse was her supervisor, please donate to a women in stem scholarship fund!",58

"helen, we’ve designed an excellent maze for you today. just follow the cheese to the charcuterie board.",-1
"honestly, it's just a nickname. call me catherine.",-1
yes your mother was a guineas pig,-1

she's not that into you.,-1
"remember, after you shove the cake in her face and fall to the floor, ask yourself: was it done in a loving way?",18
"when her sister came to pick me up, i heard her say she had the hots for you.",-1
"everyone's been talking about me! for some reason, they keep calling me, 'the bride's cake,' though.",18

the wind picked her  and pitched her over the fence.,-1

"i understand, mrs wilson, but our new intern came very highly recommended.",261
"i'm sorry madam, it's a fake. but i'll give you a buck.",60
"better put away the red scarf, susan.",-1
you think she'll fall for that line of bull?,26

"what’s that, karen— you’d like to speak to the manager?",6
here's trouble???  no no  that's deborah.  she's a cow.  no bull.,26
despite the evidence mom still doesn't believe in evolution.,-1

"ma’am, i am the manager, this piece is authentic and we will not refund your money.",60
"i’m just saying, you sound a little prejudiced karen",6

she’s trying to understand what a bull market is,26
"o ye of little faith, carol, o ye of little faith.",55

"the moment someone walks in her wearing red, you'll regret this hiring.",-1
she's a great customer but tends to knock a lot of stuff over.,49
luckily she’s not wearing a red coat,-1
"if this doesn't match her spode, i'll dash it myself.",-1
"ma’am, this is the very same china used in the capital building and it survived!",26
"in this shop, i'm more afraid of a lady with a handbag who thinks the bull won't give her a decent figure.",26
when it comes to china she knows her bull.,26
isn’t that mrs. friedman from 14b?,-1
"it’s pronounced ‘dar-be,’ not ‘der-be,’ ma’am.",-1
"she wants me to take her on as a partner. but the way i figure it, i already got the milk.",205

the lady will look at this pattern! the milk from this cup is ambrosia!,205
it's always calm until the bargaining starts. then doris turns into a battleaxe.,68

"she's actually a cow, but that's all the agency had for what we could pay.",26
"cut the bull, martha. this is a true wedgewood. now, should i wrap it up for you?",-1
hope her debit card isn’t red.,49

she's promising again to be more careful shopping here.,49
"i opened this shop in memory of my late wife, whomst passed away in 2016. she loved fine china and antiques. for a few years, running it made me feel like she was still around- every time i’d see a happy customer walk out the door with a new treasure, i’d be reminded of her, and how happy each curio would make her. unfortunately, things have been slow due to the pandemic. honestly, it’s looking like we might have to shut down next month. coping with my wife’s passing was hard enough the first time, and now it feels like the virus is killing her memory again. haha i’m also a bull!",41

and then she called me cold-blooded.,336
can we skip over the rest of my mom stuff and move on to the metamorphosis?,-1
i see - your mother's striped couch made you feel like an inmate,80
so your wife then said that you finally showed your true colours,95
but mother always told me i could be anything i wanted to be.,-1
so you're looking for a mate who will show her true colors?,95

she looked right past me. i feel like i’m not seen in my relationships.,119
did i tell you that my mother's a lizard?,-1

it all started when my mother made me wear plaid suits.,81
is that my mother on your feet?,107
"now that you mention it, my mother did like me best when i matched her favorite dress",81
let’s explore why you blame your mother for your compulsive need to fit in.,271
"i feel like she sees right through me, but at the same time can’t be bothered to look at me. it’s infuriating!",119
i'm sorry.  the print pattern was my wife's idea.,-1
tell me about your mother.,16

my wife and kids tell me i'm cold-blooded.,336
you say my relationship with my mother is the reason i have a reptile dysfunction?!,-1
my wife makes me feel like i'm part of the furniture!,-1

and when did your mother begin withholding insects?,255
"i took on the appearance of her cat and ate her gerbil.
you gotta help me come clean, doc.",10
did you get that part about my mother?,-1
"i mean, i *like* flies, but it was my birthday and it just felt like she phoned it in.",-1
i feel like she looks at me but she doesn’t *see* me. you know?,119
tell me why you feel like a frog and not a princess.,-1
‘’and you believe it was important to your mother that you always fit in?’,-1
i think it must be because i’m a middle-aged woman.,3
you can’t blame yourself for her lack of trust; let her see the real you.,-1
"before you continue, can you tell my mother to stop disguising herself as your medical license?",-1
"what' s wrong in me, doctor? all the times i fall in love with a woman, she disappears.",181

so you say your mother never really accepted your colorful side,95
i've always found my mother hard to read.,-1
so now we tackle your emotional challenge of not being able to get a lady to go out with you.,-1
so your mother never let you be the colourful person you always wanted to be,95
my mother never told me i’d have to learn to craw first,-1
my wife is always pushing me to change.,260
'so you blended in with the yellow wallpaper and sent the poor lady mad by moving about?',272
patient believes no one notices her. must learn to stand out.,284
we've been married so long she wouldn't notice if i lay on the couch stark naked.,-1
my mom told me i was born to stand out but i’m beginning to think she didn’t know the real me,-1

she said i wasn't blending in.,40
and then she said my art wasn’t original enough for her.,168
and then she ran off with a horned lizard!,-1
"…and then she said she’d ‘seen my true colors’ and left me, doc.",95
your mother... you say she just doesn’t see you.,-1
she says she left because i never showed her the real me.,296
"my mother never stopped yelling at me to hold my tongue""",-1
soooo....your mother kept you in a cage?,-1

i could never tell what color my mother was going to be that day.,95
and you say you were offended when she called you a chameleon?,-1
my wife says i have no integrity.,0
"why are you writing 'paranoid'? who put you up to this, my mother?",-1
"but when i find her, how will i know?",-1
and then she has the hide to say i’ll never change,-1
