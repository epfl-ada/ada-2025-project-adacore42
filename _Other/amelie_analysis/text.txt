Research questions 

Axis 3: Gender Roles

- How are men and women depicted in New Yorker cartoons and captions, and do these depictions reflect traditional gender roles or stereotypes?

- How does audience response (e.g., votes or winning captions) relate to gendered content—do captions about one gender receive more positive attention, and does this reinforce or challenge stereotypes?

Methods 

This section investigates how men and women are depicted in cartoons and captions, the language patterns associated with each gender, and how audience responses relate to these depictions.

Data Preparation

Gender annotation: Identify men, women, or gender-neutral characters in cartoons and captions using a gendered dictionary.

Feature extraction: Capture lexical features (word frequency, co-occurrences, role categories), sentiment (polarity, subjectivity), and audience metrics (votes, winning captions).

Analysis

Language Patterns: Analyze word usage and co-occurrences, generate word clouds, and track changes over time.

Audience Response: Compare sentiment and success of captions mentioning men vs women, and assess whether stereotypical portrayals are rewarded.
