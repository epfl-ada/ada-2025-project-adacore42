    "# <center> Punchlines as Mirrors: Social Attitudes, Politics, and Biases in the *The New Yorker* Caption Contest\n",
    "\n",
    "Humor reflects society’s views, stereotypes, and political climate. The New Yorker Caption Contest offers a unique lens into this process, showing what people find acceptable, absurd, or taboo.\n",
    "\n",
    "## <center> Narrative Flow\n",
    "- **Introduction:** The Caption Contest as a cultural mirror — humor as social data.\n",
    "- **Axis 1:** Professions & politics → humor about authority and power, *“What are people laughing about?”*\n",
    "- **Axis 2:** Humor in time → historical & contextual dimensions, *“When and why do jokes resonate?”*\n",
    "- **Axis 3:** Social norms → gender roles & taboos, testing the limits of humor, *“What’s acceptable or not?”*\n",
    "- **Axis 4:** Biases → explain psychological and cultural mechanisms behind why we laugh, *“Why do we find it funny?”*\n",
    "- **Conclusion:** Humor not only entertains — it reveals evolving attitudes, biases, and the cultural pulse of society.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Idea for website:** Each section should begin with a set of cartoons from the contest to immerse the viewer in humor before moving to analysis.\n",

    "### <center> 1. Professions, Politics, and Power\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Professions in Humor:** Which jobs are depicted most often? Which are ridiculed vs. admired? What stereotypes recur (e.g., lawyers as tricksters, doctors as saviors)?\n",
    "- **Politics in Humor:** Do captions reflect partisan leanings (Democrat vs. Republican) or mock political figures more broadly? Are political jokes rated differently?\n",
    "- **Interplay:** Professions like politicians or lawyers sit at the crossroads of both — this axis highlights how authority and social roles are viewed through humor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Plots / Statistics:**\n",
    "- Bar / Word Clouds: Frequency of professions mentioned in captions (“doctor,” “lawyer,” “politician”).\n",
    "- Histograms / Line Plots: Frequency of professions across time.\n",
    "- Grouped Bar Charts: Average funniness scores by profession category (healthcare, law, politics, education, etc.).\n",
    "- Heatmaps: Cross-tab professions × sentiment (positive/negative/neutral).\n",
    "- Cartoon + Caption Samples: A few annotated cartoons showing how professions are ridiculed.\n",

    "**For Politics:**\n",
    "- Timeline of mentions of political figures/parties.\n",
    "- Sentiment distribution around Democrats vs. Republicans.\n",
    "- Example “political joke clusters” side by side with major events (e.g., elections).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Statistical Tests & Models:**\n",
    "- t-tests / z-tests → Compare funniness scores of politicians vs. other professions.\n",
    "- Multiple hypothesis testing (FDR/BH) → Control for comparisons across 30+ job categories.\n",
    "- Network graphs → Co-occurrence of profession keywords with stereotypes (“lawyer–money,” “doctor–death”).\n",
    "- Linear regression / lmplot → Test if political humor ratings rise around elections.\n",
    "- Pearsonr / Spearmanr → Correlation between real-world political cycles and joke frequency.\n"

    "- **Frequency of depiction:** Which jobs appear most often in captions?  \n",
    "- **Stereotypes:** How are certain professions portrayed — are they admired, ridiculed, or caricatured?  \n",

    "- **Interplay with politics:** Some professions, like politicians or lawyers, intersect with both professional and political commentary, highlighting how authority and social power are perceived.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## <center> Analytical Approach\n",
    "To study professions in humor, we will:\n",
    "- Count the number of times each profession is mentioned across all captions.  \n",
    "- Visualize the distribution with **bar charts** or **word clouds**.  \n",
    "- Examine sentiment associated with professions using **heatmaps**.  \n",

    "To count the occurrences of professions in the captions, we will use the 2018 U.S. Census occupation data as a reference.  \n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The problem with this approach is that occupations occur in their _colloquial_ form and not in their full _official_ title. This will make using the occupation indexes way too difficult. We must find a way to take the census data, and group it into smaller, colloquial terms (for example the occupation of midwife nurse from the census data should simply be nurse or midwife). The following approach is taken:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clean the census data by lower casing, removing trailing spaces, taking away special characters like brackets and hyphens.\n",
    "- Some jobs are \"complicated title\" See \"simpler title\" -> lets cut all such instances as they are essentially the same as the simpler titles\n",
    "- There are some occupations of the form \"Analyst\\ specified type See type of analyst\" and \"Clerk\\any other specified   Code by duties\" etc. I want to remove these and make them simpler\n",
    "- It can be seen that some titles have entries like \"CFO (Chief Financial Officer)\" -> create a new column with alternative name, and delete from first column"
