# _Other\cycy_analysis\similarity_between_captions.ipynb

A jupyter notebook where I try to build a similarity metric bewteen 2 captions.
- semantic similarity
- structure similarity
- combined similarity
A similarity matrix is created comparing similarity between each pair of captions within one contest.
--> heatmap plot of this captions similarity matrix within one contest
--> scatterplot of the score v.s. similarity within one contest
==> *WHAT'S NEXT ?* To be ameliorated !

I also try to plot a network of common themes within one contest using cleaned_data from Andras's preprocessing and lemification/tokenisation,
but not sucessful for the moment.
==> *WHAT'S NEXT ?* To be changed !




# src\utils\general_utils.py

A python file where we can put general utilities useful in different scripts.
- absolute_index2contest_index
- contest_index2absolute_index

For the moment, just two function that allow us to find easily the corresponding indexes in absolut or contest
==> *WHAT'S NEXT ?* I plan maybe to add a cosinus distance function, helpful for many distance metrics (mostly used in text processing)
